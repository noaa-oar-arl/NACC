!  DO NOT EDIT !!
!
!       The EDSS/Models-3 I/O API depends in an essential manner
!       upon the contents of this INCLUDE file.  ANY CHANGES are
!       likely to result in very obscure, difficult-to-diagnose
!       bugs caused by an inconsistency between standard "libioapi.a"
!       object-libraries and whatever code is compiled with the
!       resulting modified INCLUDE-file.
!
!       By making any changes to this INCLUDE file, the user
!       explicitly agrees that in the case any assistance is
!       required of MCNC or of the I/O API author, Carlie J. Coats, Jr.
!       as a result of such changes, THE USER AND/OR HIS PROJECT OR
!       CONTRACT AGREES TO REIMBURSE MCNC AND/OR THE I/O API AUTHOR,
!       CARLIE J. COATS, JR., AT A RATE TRIPLE THE NORMAL CONTRACT
!       RATE FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED.
!
!  CONTAINS:  Fortran data structures for a MODELS 3 file description
!             for file type TSRIES3 (timeseries).  Based upon FDESC3.EXT.
!             Used to pass data between RDDICT3, WRDICT3, CREATE3, DESC3,
!             and their callers.  Common BATTS3 is used to store the
!             non-character-string data, and CATTS3 is used to store
!             the character-string data (recall that FORTRAN 77 prohibits
!             character and non-character data in the same common)
!
!  SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A NAME BASED ARGUMENT PASSING MECHANISM;
!  the user should have local variables to/from which this data structure
!  is copied immediately prior to or immediately after calls which set
!  or use these COMMONs, since their values are subject to change at
!  any time by the IOAPI.
