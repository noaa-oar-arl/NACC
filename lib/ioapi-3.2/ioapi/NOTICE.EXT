!       The EDSS/Models-3 I/O API depends in an essential manner
!       upon the I/O API source code.  ANY CHANGES to INCLUDE files
!       are likely to result in very obscure, difficult-to-diagnose
!       bugs caused by an inconsistency between standard "libioapi.a"
!       object-libraries and whatever code is compiled with the
!       resulting modified INCLUDE-file.
!
!       By making any changes to any of these INCLUDE files, the user
!       explicitly agrees that in the case any assistance is required
!       of MCNC, BAMS, or of the I/O API author, Carlie J. Coats, Jr.,
!       as a result of such changes, THE USER AND/OR HIS PROJECT OR
!       CONTRACT AGREES TO REIMBURSE MCNC AND/OR BAMS AND/RO THE I/O API
!       AUTHOR, CARLIE J. COATS, JR., AT A RATE TRIPLE THE NORMAL CONTRACT
!       RATE FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED.
