    This work was initiated by the author,  Carlie J. Coats, Jr., under
    U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency Contract
    No.&nbsp;68-W0-0043-462 between US&nbsp;EPA  and Computer Sciences
    Corporation, and continued by the author at MCNC/NCSC Environmental
    Programs, also with partial funding under cooperative agreements
    with US&nbsp;EPA, and then at Baron Advanced Meteorological
    Systems and the University of North Carolina&mdash;Institute for the
    Environment.  The author would  like to thank EPA's Atmospheric
    Research and Environmental Assessment Laboratory (whose Regional
    Oxidant Model utility and I/O library  provided a fine example
    of how modeling could be aided by the use  of a fine selective
    direct-access library, and which explored many of the pitfalls in
    such a library so that Models-3 and EDSS could avoid them) for
    supporting this work, and the following people who made valuable
    contributions to and suggestions for its development:  
    <UL>
       <LI>  Dr. Frank Binkowski, EPA; 
       <LI>  Dr. Daewon Byun, EPA, 
       <LI>  Dr. Dongming Hwang, MCNC; 
       <LI>  Miss Kathy Pearson, MCNC;
       <LI>  Mr. Kenneth Schere, EPA/NOAA; 
       <LI>  Dr. Uma Shankar, MCNC; 
       <LI>  Mr. David Tivel, SDC;
       <LI>  Dr. George Delic, HiPERiSM Consulting LLC;
       <LI>  Dr. Jeffrey Young, EPA/NOAA;
       <LI>  Mr. Edward Anderson, Lockheed-Martin;
       <LI>  Dr. David Wong, EPA; and
       <LI>  all the others at EPA, MCNC, NOAA, SDC, and UNC who contributed
             to its development, many of whom are credited in the
             <A HREF = "NEWSTUFF.html">Change Log</A>.

    The author would also like to thank the 
    <A HREF = "http://home.ucar.edu/index.html">University Corporation
    for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)</A>, and its technology-transfer arm
    <A HREF = "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/">Unidata</A>, on top of whose 
    <A HREF = "https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/"> 
    netCDF</A> interface for persistent data access the I/O&nbsp;API was
    built, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, on top of whose 
    <A HREF="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM-3</A>
    mailbox system the cooperating-process 
    <A HREF="BUFFERED.html#pvm"> coupling-mode</A> of the I/O&nbsp;API
    was built.  Without these, it would have been much more difficult
    to construct an easy-to-use, multi-mode modeler-oriented
    machine-independent selective direct access interface to
    air-quality-oriented data.
