<H2> Summary: </H2>
    Open or create EDSS/Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#kfevnt">KF 
    event file</A> with <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html">logical  
    name</A> FNAME, with  file mode/status FSTATUS of one of 
    the following 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; tokens </A> 
    (defined in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">  PARMS3.EXT </A>):
<PRE>
    FSREAD3==1 for read-only,
    FSRDWR3==2 for read/write/update of existing files,
    FSNEW3 ==3 for read/write of new files,
    FSUNKN3==4 for read/write/update of unknown (new vs. old)
               files.  If file does not exist, create it; 
               else check for consistency with user-supplied
               file description
    FSCREA3==5 for create/truncate/read/write of files.
               If file exists, delete it; then create a new
               (empty) file according to the user-supplied
               file description
</PRE><P> 

    If FNAME is being opened for write, copies 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> scenario description </A>
    from file with logical name SCENDESC, name PGNAME of the 
    caller, and value of 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> environment variable </A>
    EXECUTION_ID to 
    the file's history (maintained in the file header).
    <P> 
    
    Returns current gridded event count in <CODE>BUFFER</CODE>,
    which should previously have been declared as in integer 
    array dimensioned with the current columns and rows:
    <PRE>
    INTEGER     KFCOUNT( NCOLS3D, NROWS3D )
    </PRE>
    <P> 
    
    If file may possibly be created (i.e., if the access mode is
    either FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3), the user must supply a file
    description in the COMMONs in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> (for
    Fortran) or in the data structures pointed to by arguments
    bdesc and cdesc (for C).  In the latter case, the file
    description struct pointers are only required when the file is
    being opened &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot;.
    <P> 

    <STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> Joan Novak (EPA)  and Ed Bilicki (MCNC) 
    have declared as a software standard that <STRONG>modeling programs
    may not  use FSCREA3 as the mode for opening files.</STRONG>  
    FSCREA3 is reserved for use by analysis/data extraction programs
    only.
    <P>

    May be called multiple times for a file (provided you don't
    attempt to go from readonly to any read/write status), or subsequent
    to an OPEN3() call on the same file, in which case it simply returns
    the event-count information in BUFFER.  Except as a means of reading 
    the gridded event count, deprecated in favor of inclusion of the 
    similar functionality into <A HREF = "OPEN3.html">OPEN3()</A>.
    <P>

    KFOPEN() is OpenMP thread-safe.
    <P> 

<H2> Preconditions: </H2>

    <P> 

    FNAME must have length at most 16.
    <P> 
    
    For FSREAD3 or FSRDWR3, file must already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For FSNEW3, file must <EM>not</EM> already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3, caller must supply file description
    (which must follow Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> 
    date and time conventions </A>).
    <P> 
    
    I/O API must already be initialized by a call to 
    <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() or init3c(). </A>
    <P> 
    
    KFOPEN() must not be called for read/write/update (FSRDWR3, FSNEW3,
    FSUNK3, or FSCREA3) on a file already open for read-only (FSREAD3).
    <P>

    KFOPEN() must not be called for new (FSNEW3) on a file already
    open or that already exists.
