<H1>    Program M3STAT </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>

<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;     &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;reportfile&gt; &lt;path name&gt;
    m3stat [&lt;infile&gt; [&lt;reportfile&gt;]] [&lt;DEFAULT&gt;]
        &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> 
    of the input file, and <VAR>reportfile</VAR> is the logical name of the 
    report file (to which the statistical report is printed).  
    If <VAR>reportfile</VAR> is not present, the report will go either to 
    the <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> log file </A> (if it is set) or 
    to the screen.  If neither is present, the program will prompt the
    user for both input file and report file logical names.  If DEFAULT
    is the last command-line argument, then <VAR>m3stat</VAR> does the
    default statistical analysis.
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    The <VAR>m3stat</VAR> program reports the result of a statistical 
    analysis of <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A> from a 
    user-specified 
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary"> BOUNDARY</A> ,
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom"> CUSTOM</A> ,
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#iddata"> ID-REFERENCED</A> ,
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRIDDED</A> , or
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#smatrx">SPARSE MATRIX</A> 
    Models-3 file.  The analysis can be either the default (which reports
    max and its grid-cell location, min and its location, mean, and
    standard deviation for each variable for each time step, or a 
    user-customized one which does both statistical analysis and also 
    threshold analysis on selected variables with user-supplied thresholds, 
    and for a user-selected time period.  Threshold analysis answers
    questions like the following example: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM>
        For what fraction of the grid does OZONE in this file 
        exceed 0.120?
        </EM>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P> 

    For each time step for each selected variable, the program reports 
    statistics on that variable to the 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> program log </A> or to an optional 
    user-selected <STRONG>report file</STRONG>.
    <P>

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
    names of both the input file and the report file (if any), according 
    to Models-3 conventions, using the operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical name you
    have chosen for the input file, the logical name for the optional 
    report file (Enter &quot;NONE&quot; for the file name if you want an 
    interactive report or a report to the program log), and then extensively 
    for the options to choose; the prompts will have default responses which 
    can be accepted by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of 
    starting date and time, and duration for the analysis follow Models-3 
    <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    Note that the set of analyses which can be performed by one
    execution of M3STAT is quite complex, being dependent upon the
    variables and other structures in the file being analyzed. If you
    want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG>  (i.e.,
    from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively while noting the pattern of
    responses  to prompts which generate the particular analysis you
    want.  The  pattern of responses then becomes either a
    command-input file which  is redirected into the program's
    execution by the script, or becomes  a &quot;here-document&quot;
    fed into the execution.  The following  is an excerpt of a script
    which does the default analysis on  <CODE>/tmp/myfile.A</CODE>
    using the here-document approach:
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv FOO  /tmp/myfile.A
    m3stat  &lt;&lt;  !DONE
    FOO
    Yes, I want the default analysis
                 # use the default run length:  entire duration of the files
!DONE
    ...
</PRE>
