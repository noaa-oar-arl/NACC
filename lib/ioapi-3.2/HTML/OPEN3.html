<H1>    OPEN3()  and  open3c() </H1>

<H2> Fortran version: </H2>
<PRE>
    LOGICAL FUNCTION  OPEN3( FNAME, FSTATUS, PGNAME )
        CHARACTER*(*), INTENT(IN   ) :: FNAME   !  file name for query
        INTEGER      , INTENT(IN   ) :: FSTATUS !  FSREAD3, FSRDWR3, FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, FSCREA3
        CHARACTER*(*), INTENT(IN   ) :: PGNAME  !  name of calling program
</PRE><P> 

<H2> C version: </H2>  open3c() is a C wrapper calling the Fortran OPEN3()
<PRE>
    int open3c( const char          * fname ,

<H2> See Also:</H2> 
    <A HREF = "PROMPTMFILE.html"><CODE>PROMPTMFILE()</CODE></A>,
    which is a (text-mode interactive) wrapper around <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> that
    prompts the user for the logical name of the file to be opened.
    <P>
    Also see <A HREF = "GETDFILE.html"><CODE>GETDFILE()</CODE></A> and
    <A HREF = "GETEFILE.html"><CODE>GETEFILE()</CODE></A>, for opening
    Fortran sequential and direct access files by logical name.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary: </H2>
    Open or create Models-3 file with <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    logical name </A> <CODE>FNAME</CODE>, with  file mode/status
    <CODE>FSTATUS</CODE> of one of 
    the following 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; tokens </A> 
    (defined in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"><VAR>PARMS3.EXT</VAR></A>):
<PRE>
    FSREAD3==1 for read-only,
    FSRDWR3==2 for read/write/update of existing files,
    FSNEW3 ==3 for read/write of new files (file must not
               already exist),
    FSUNKN3==4 for read/write/update of unknown (new vs. old)
               files.  If file does not exist, create it; 
               else check for consistency with user-supplied
               file description.
    FSCREA3==5 for create/truncate/read/write of files.
               If file exists, delete it; then create a new
               (empty) file according to the user-supplied
               file description
</PRE><P> 

    If FNAME is being opened for write, copies
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> scenario description </A> from file
    with logical name <CODE>SCENDESC</CODE>, name <CODE>PGNAME</CODE> of
    the  caller, and value of  <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> environment
    variable </A> <CODE>EXECUTION_ID</CODE> to  the file's history
    (maintained in the file header).
    <P> 

    May be called multiple times for a file (provided you don't
    attempt to go from readonly to any read/write status).
    <P> 
    
    If file may possibly be created (i.e., if the access mode is either
    <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>, or <CODE>FSCREA3</CODE>),
    the user must supply a file description in the <CODE>COMMON</CODE>s
    in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"><VAR>FDESC3.EXT</VAR></A> (for
    Fortran) or in the data structures pointed to by arguments
    <CODE>bdesc</CODE> and <CODE>cdesc</CODE> (for C).  In the latter
    case, the file description struct pointers are only required when
    the file is being opened &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot;.
    <P> 

    &quot;Normal&quot; modeling usage should be to open input files as
    <CODE>FSREAD3</CODE> and output files as <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>.  If
    you open output files  as <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, you must take care to
    remove pre-existing files before running your program.
    <P>

    <STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> Joan Novak (EPA)  and Ed Bilicki (MCNC) 
    have declared as a software standard that <STRONG>modeling programs
    may not  use <CODE>FSCREA3</CODE> as the mode for opening
    files.</STRONG>   <CODE>FSCREA3</CODE> is reserved for use by
    analysis/data extraction programs only.
    <P>

<H2> Preconditions: </H2>  

    <CODE><A HREF = "M3UTILIO.html">USE M3UTILIO</A></CODE> or
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#iodecl"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'IODECL3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    and 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'FDESC3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    for Fortran, or <BR>
    <CODE>#include &quot;iodecl3.h&quot;</CODE> and 
    <CODE>#include &quot;fdesc3.h&quot;</CODE> for C.
    <P> 

    <CODE>FNAME</CODE> must have length at most 16.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSREAD3</CODE> or <CODE>FSRDWR3</CODE>, file must already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, file must <EM>not</EM> already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>, if the file already exists, the file type,
    dimensions, time step and variables supplied by the caller must
    match those on the file.  The caller-supplied starting date and time
    must be a legal output time step in the time step sequence found on
    the file:  for example, if the starting time from the file header
    is 1997012:120000, and the time step is one hour (10000), then
    opening this file  <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE> with a caller-supplied
    starting date and time of 1997012:180000 is OK (that would be
    time step number 7 for the file-header time step sequence) but
    a caller-supplied 1997011:120000 is not, since it is before the
    starting date and time from the file itself.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>, or
    <CODE>FSCREA3</CODE>, caller must supply file description (which
    must follow Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html">date and time
    conventions</A>).
    <P> 
    
    I/O&nbsp;API must already be initialized by a call to 
    <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() or init3c(). </A>
    <P> 
    
    <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> must not be called for read/write/update
    (<CODE>FSRDWR3, FSNEW3, FSUNK3</CODE>, or <CODE>FSCREA3</CODE>) on a
    file already open for read-only (<CODE>FSREAD3</CODE>).
    <P>

    <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> must not be called for new
    (<CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>) on a file already open (if the file
    already exists, that contradicts the &quot;new&quot;).
    <P>
