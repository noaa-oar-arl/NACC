<H2><A NAME = "paradigm"> 
     I/O&nbsp;API:  Paradigm 
</A></H2>

    The <A HREF = "index.html">EDSS/Models-3 
    I/O&nbsp;API</A> is a library of routines which provide 
    selective direct access to modeling data in modeler-oriented 
    terms.  For example, the <VAR>read-and-interpolate</VAR> 
    operation is typified by the call
    
        <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
        INTERP3( 'foo', 'bar', 1, 1988200, 120000, NCOLS*NROWS, BAR )
        </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    which says, in ordinary English,
        
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        Read the layer-1, year 1988, day 200, time 12:00:00 slice of 
        the variable named &quot;bar&quot; from the file with logical
        name<SUP><A HREF = "#f1">1</A></SUP> &quot;foo&quot; and 
        put it into array <CODE>BAR</CODE> having extent
        <CODE>NCOLS*NROWS</CODE> (extent being used for error checking
        purposes).
        <EM>NOTE:  INTERP3() optimizes disk-accesses and
        double buffering behind the scenes at run-time.</EM>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

    This paradigm of operation greatly reduces modeling complexity
    (as compared to models built around sequential files), since a
    model does not need to know the detailed structure of a file it
    reads (e.g., the exact list of variables in the file, their order, 
    nor even the precise time step structure).  What it does need to
    know is the names, types, and dimensionality of the variables it
    wants to read, and must deal with error-flags coming from requests
    that cannot be fulfilled.  EPA'a Models-3 and NCSC's MAQSIP models 
    take advantage of this flexibility in order to construct 
    &quot;plug-compatible interchangeable-part&quot; modules 
    implementing the various relevant atmospheric 
    processes.<SUP><A HREF = "#f2">2</A></SUP>  Notice that this kind 
    of selective direct-access I/O makes for models that are more robust, 
    and less &quot;brittle&quot;as well:  if a new variable is added to a 
    file, only those modules which write or read the new variable need
    to change; all others are unaffected.
    <P> 
    

<H2><A NAME = "concept">
     Model Coupling:  Concept 
</A></H2>

    Just as a model's access to disk files should not demand intimately
    detailed internal knowledge of the structure of the file or of its
    writer, coupled models composed of cooperating concurrent processes
    should not require that receivers possess intimately detailed
    internal knowledge of senders (and vice versa).  Ideally, a model
    should use the same facilities for disk I/O and for <STRONG>virtual
    files</STRONG> used for model coupling,
    and should not &quot;need&quot; to know whether its inputs are
    coming from disk files or from other models coupled to it.
    Synchronization and scheduling should be done on the basis of data
    availability.
    In order for this to work, the following properties
    are required for model-coupling mode of the I/O&nbsp;API, and of
    the models that use it:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  OPEN3() for virtual input files block until (i.e., the
              operating system puts the calling process to sleep until)
              some process opens them for writing, thus making the
              file-description available for the reader.

        <LI>  Virtual-file reads (READ3(), INTERP3(), and XTRACT3()) 
              block until the data they request becomes available.

        <LI>  If any virtual files are open, SHUT3() waits until all
              processes with open virtual files are ready to exit, and
              then cleans up the mailboxes for all of its process's
              virtual output files. 

        <LI>  Models must be structured so as to avoid deadlock (i.e.,
              so that two cooperating processes never get into the
              situation of both requesting data the other hasn't
              produced yet).  One set of rules for avoiding deadlocks
              is the following:
              <UL>  
                  <LI>  Open all output virtual files before opening
                        any input virtual files; and
                  <LI>  Write all output for a time step before
                        requesting any input for the next time step.
                  <LI>  Don't skip any time steps.
              </UL>               

        <LI>  Coupling must be two-way:  processes writing virtual files 
              must get some feedback from at least one reader, to prevent 
              them from racing ahead and exhausting all available buffer
              space.  (In the most extreme case of a single writer and a
              single reader, the reader might artificially produce a 
              single-cell-sized synchronization file which the writer
              reads, to keep the writer from racing far ahead of the reader).

     Model Coupling:  Examples 
</A></H2>

    the models that use it:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  The <A HREF="/projects/SECMEP/">MCNC real time air quality
              forecast system</A> uses coupling mode to tie together
              the (monolithic single-program but multiple-grid) MM5
              meteorology model, the (multi-program-per-grid) SMOKE
              emissions model, and the (single-program-per-grid)
              MAQSIP-RT atmospheric chemistry and transport model. 
              Note that it is necessary to introduce an artificial
              2-hour-lagged feedback from each MAQSIP-RT to MM5, in
              order to prevent MM5 from racing ahead of the MAQSIPs.
              <P>
        <LI>  The <A HREF="/projects/SECMEP/">data assimilating
              hydrological/meteorological model</A> uses I/O&nbsp;API
              coupling mode to tie together the MM5 meteorology model
              and the TOPLATS land surface/hydrology model at the MM5
              advection time scale.  In this model, MM5 provides ambient
              meteorology to TOPLATS, which then provides very accurate
              surface fluxes back to MM5.
              <P>
        <LI>  The <A HREF="DECOMP_AQM.html">Distributed/Decomposed-AQM
              Modeling System</A> is an example of another kind of
              application for the I/O API coupling mode.  In it, the 
              horizontal domain of the air quality model is decomposed
              into a set of rectangular subdomains (that overlap by one
              cell on interior edges, to preserve the order of the
              advection algorithm).  A &quot;normal&quot; single-grid
              air quality model is run on each subdomain, with input and
              output time step equal to the required model advection step.
              Then at each advection step, the <CODE>AQMMASTER</CODE>
              program assembles the subdomain concentrations into a
              full-domain field, writes the full-grid concentration file
              if appropriate, and extracts and writes advection-step
              chemical boundary files for each of the subdomains (the
              whole system being tied together/scheduled by Coupling
              Mode virtual files).  The <CODE>METSERVER</CODE> program
              is used in this system to provide subdomain meteorology
              files to each subdomain air quality model.

<H2><A NAME = "implementation"> 
     Model Coupling:  Implementation 
</A></H2>

    Our implementation is built on top of &quot;mailboxes&quot; in
    PVM 3.4.  There is a new library, <CODE>libclp.a</CODE>, that fits
    in front of <CODE>libioapi.a</CODE> in the compile-and-link command
    line for producing programs, and which then over-rides the standard
    file-oriented OPEN3(), READ3(), etc., with the new polymorphic 
    versions which can deal with both physical files  and virtual files.
    <P>
    
    At run-time, the new OPEN3() looks at the value of its 
    logical-name<SUP><A HREF = "#f1">1</A></SUP> argument to see 
    whether the request is for a virtual file, or for a physical
    file (and in that case, what physical path-name the file has).
    For virtual files opened for writing, it then creates a PVM
    mailbox containing both the virtual file's description (number,
    names and types of variables, dimensionality, grid description, 
    etc.)
    <P> 
    
    For a virtual file, WRITE3() allocates a buffer for the requested 
    time step of the requested variable in the file's mailbox, puts
    the data into the buffer and labels it by variable-name, date, and
    time, and then cleans up any outstanding buffers for that variable
    that are more than (a default) 2 time steps old.
    <P> 
    
    For a virtual file, READ3(), INTERP3(), and XTRACT3() make up a label 
    with the requested variable-name, date, and time, and requests a copy
    of the corresponding buffer from the file's mailbox.  If a buffer with
    the corresponding label exists, PVM copies it into the requester's
    output argument; otherwise, PVM puts the requesting process to sleep
    until such a labelled buffer is written by some other process.
    <P> 

    If any virtual files are open, all calls to SHUT3() wait on a
    barrier that ensures virtual files are not destroyed prematurely.
    SHUT3() then cleans up the mailboxes for all of the virtual output
    files its process had opened (corresponding to SHUT3()'s using
    <CODE>ncclose()</CODE> to flush and close any disk files that
    were opened by that process).
