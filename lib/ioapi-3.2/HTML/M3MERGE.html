<H1>    Program M3MERGE </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile 1&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;infile 2&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    ...
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;

    m3merge <EM>&lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;</EM>
</PRE>

where <VAR>infile 1</VAR>, <VAR>infile 2</VAR>, ...  are the 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input files.  
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

The <CODE>M3MERGE</CODE> program creates a single output file from
selected sets of <A HREF = "VBLE.html">variables</A> from a set of
I/O&nbsp;API input files over a commmon grid and time period.  The input
variables must be of <A NAME = "DATATYPES.html#basic">basic data type
M3REAL</A>; all of the files must have the same grid, layer-structure, and
the same file-type, which must be one of the following:
<UL>
    <LI>  <A HREF="DATATYPES.html#grdded">GRDDED3</A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF="DATATYPES.html#bndary">BNDARY3</A>, or
    <LI>  <A HREF="DATATYPES.html#custom">CUSTOM3</A>
</UL>
<P>

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> 
    you need to assign <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A>
    to the physical file names of both files,  according to Models-3
    conventions, using the operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names you
    have chosen for the input files, for the set of variables to include
    from each file, and for the time step sequence to process.  The prompts
    have default responses indicated  in square brackets
    <CODE>[LIKE&nbsp;THIS]</CODE>, which can be accepted  by hitting
    &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of starting date and time,  target
    date and time, and number of time step records for the run follow 
    Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions.
    </A>
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
    you may redirect into the program in the script, or may become a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution by the script.  
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Versions of the program</STRONG> are available for each 
    <A HREF = "LIBS.html"> supported architecture </A>
    (workstation versions are currently in the directories 
    <VAR>/env/proj/ppar/(SunOS5f90 | IRIX6n32f90 | IRIX64f90)/bin</VAR>.
