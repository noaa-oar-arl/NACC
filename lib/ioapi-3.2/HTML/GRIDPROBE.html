<H1>    Program GRIDPROBE </H1>

<H2> Summary </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    The <VAR>gridprobe</VAR> program <STRONG>interpolates/extracts the
    time series</STRONG> for a specified variable for a specified set of
    points from a GRIDDED input file <CODE>INFILE</CODE>, and writes the
    resulting time series as columns to a (human-readable) ASCII
    <CODE>REPORT</CODE>-file. Points to be extracted are specified in
    terms of Lat-Lon coordinates taken from an ASCII <CODE>POINTS</CODE>
    file.
    <P>

    Source code for program <CODE>m3probe</CODE> is available
    <A HREF = "gpl.txt">under the GNU GPL License, Version 2</A>, and
    can be downloaded from the CMAS web site as part of the I/O&nbsp;API
    distribution tar-ball <A HREF = "AVAIL.html">from this page</A>.
    <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    <PRE>
    setenv  INFILE    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  POINTS    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  REPORT    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  HEADER    &lt;ASCII header on ${REPORT}? (Y/N) [N]&gt;
    m3probe [and answer the prompts]
    </PRE>
    where <VAR>INFILE</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical
    name </A>  of the input data file,  <VAR>POINTS</VAR> is the logical
    name of the ASCII points-file, and <VAR>REPORT</VAR> is the logical
    name of the  report file to which the ASCII time series report is
    printed.    <VAR>INFILE</VAR> must be of type <CODE>GRDDED3</CODE>.
    <VAR>POINTS</VAR> is a list-formatted (blank or comma delimited)
    ASCII file with up to 256 lines giving the latitude and longitude
    for the interpolation-points, with one point per line. <STRONG>The
    program will prompt you</STRONG> for the starting and ending date
    and time and the time step for the report period, the variable to be
    reported.  Default values for the time period are computed from the
    metadata in the <VAR>INFILE</VAR> header, and may be accepted by
    hitting the <CODE>RETURN</CODE> key.
    <P> 

    The program will log both the input Lat-Lon coordinates and the
    grid-normal coordinates
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    X<SUB>grid</SUB> = ( X - XORIG ) / XCELL<BR>
    Y<SUB>grid</SUB> = ( Y - YORIG ) / YCELL
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    of the input points, and also write that information to the 
    <CODE>REPORT</CODE>-file.
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
    is redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.
    <P>
