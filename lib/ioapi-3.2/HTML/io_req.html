         <LI>  <EM>3.1.1:  Robust,, convenient, efficient, 
               portable native file format design.</EM><P>
               is <STRONG>self-contradictory</STRONG>
               (&quot;portable&quot; vs. &quot;native&quot;)<P>
               Is unnecessarily &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot;.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.3.:  Don't assume data is coming from or going to
               files.  Eventually, support for data streamed via pipes
               or the internet is desired.</EM><P>
               We've just spent <STRONG>a <EM>lot</EM> of effort</STRONG>
               getting rid of the problems caused by stream-based data
               access assumptions&nbsp;!!!  NO! NO!! NO!!!
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.4.5:  Time-varying data...</EM><P>
               <STRONG>Deterministic clock is <EM>essential</EM></STRONG> to
               any coupled-model system.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.4.5.1: Arbitrary clock ticks </EM><P>
               NOT needed for any realistic application.<P>
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.4.5.3: Sampling resolution at least from
               <STRONG>millisecond</STRONG></EM><P>
               I don't really believe this.  Neither did ORD when
               queried about it during the Models-3 Requirements phase!
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.4.7:  Variety of 1D, 2D and 3D grid cell types:
               points, lines, triangles, quadrillaterals, polygons,
               tetrahedra, hexahedra, etc.</EM><P>
               <UL>
                   <LI> This is grossly inadequate to handle geospatial
                        polygon data such as comes from GIS coverages.
                   <LI> This will lead to referential integrity problems
                        and enormously increased storage/communications
                        costs when one is forced to arbitrarily
                        triangulate entities that are properly more
                        complex networks/polygons/polyhedra.
                   <LI> The distinction between <EM>topology</EM>
                        and <EM>geometry</EM> is ignored.
                   <LI> What about cases with <EM>time dependent
                        geometry</EM>??
               </UL>
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.4.11.1 Quantity, units, <STRONG>range,
               accuracy</STRONG>, etc.</EM><P>
               We've been through this one in detail before: 
               non-structural metadata is <STRONG>properly the subject 
               of post-processing</STRONG> and not of the I/O interface.
               This represents a major failure to separate concerns (or
               a major violation of modularity) in the analysis.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.5.1 Main memory and processor-time efficient
               buffered/paged/cached data subset access.</EM><P>
               ...is <STRONG>definitely required</STRONG>  We are
               already at the point where data volumes are on the
               order of 1&nbsp;GB/variable/day, and where vis systems
               (such as <VAR>Vis5d</VAR> that assume
               &quot;Everything--including seek pointers and
               address-offsets--is an <VAR>int</VAR> are grossly
               inappropriate.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>3.5.2:  Spatial interpolation and
               aggregation.</EM><P>
               should be under the modeler's control, and should
               probably be done via time-independent transform matrices,
               not by an API that wastes time redundantly computing the
               necessary transforms.  <EM>That's why SMOKE is so much
               faster and more efficient than EPS!</EM>

    <UL>
         <LI>  <EM>4.3.2 Data access should be buffered to allow
               access of datasets too large to fit into main memory.</EM>
               <P>
               <STRONG>Definitely required:  </STRONG> the dataset for
               the 2000 AMS presentation was 38&nbsp;GB--because we
               extracted/cut down just the subset we needed.  The
               original was 300 GB.<P>
               Projected in-memory requirement for large TOPLATS
               visualizations is on the order of <STRONG>5 PB</STRONG>.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>4.3.4 Visualization frame rates for interactive
               applications should be greater than three frames per
               second.</EM>
               <P>
               How large an app?  This is not achievable in general,
               even with dedicated access to an ASCI-class machine.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>4.5.1 MCNC M3IO Library (Carlie Coats).</EM>
         <P>
               &lt;PLEADING&gt;It's not &quot;M3IO&quot;, damn

         <LI>  <EM>Support for some GIS-like computational capabilities
               (area, distance, intersection)</EM>
               <P>
               And many more:  see <EM><A
               HREF="gefile.html">
               gefile.html</A></EM>
               for just a start.
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>Support for non-spherical earth</EM>
               <P>
               This can also be handled on the application level
               (e.g., proposed WRF standard to pass all georegistration
               questions through &quot;WRF standard-sphere-Lat/Lon&quot;
               and &quot;GRS80-Lat/Lon&quot;)
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>Support for heterogenous data types in a collection 
               of data</EM>
               What does this mean?
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>While fast access is important I don't think
               purely random access is essential</EM>
               <P>
               <STRONG>No! NO! NO!</STRONG> -- our current models
               <EM>and model couplings</EM> are based on getting
               <STRONG>away</STRONG> from the sequential dependencies
               that caused such problems in the 1980's!  
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>No support for F77 is required</EM>
               <P>
               What if we deal with MM5?  Note that the full strength
               of F90 is as complex and as fraught with surprises as 
               the worst of C++ ever has been.  And at that, <EM>neither
               language</EM> has a powerful-enough polymorphism paradigm
               for what we need to do with I/O!
               <P>
         <LI>  <EM>It would be desirable to define data objects 
               that encapsulate transformation on one or more data
               sets</EM>
               <P>
               And rather more than that... which is why there are
               <A HREF="M3CPLE.html">M3CPLE</A> and 
               <A
               HREF="MTXCPLE.html">MTXCPLE</A>.
               <P>
         <LI>  For mixed media applications, <STRONG>there <EM>must</EM>
               be I/O&nbsp;API coupling mode</STRONG> or its equivalent.
