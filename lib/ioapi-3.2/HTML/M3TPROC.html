<H1>    Program M3TPROC </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;  &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt; &lt;path name&gt;
    m3tproc [&lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;]
        &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical
    name </A>  of the input file, and <VAR>outfile</VAR> is the logical
    name of the  output file (to which the cell-wise (usually gridded)
    aggregates are written). If the file-name arguments are not
    present, the program will prompt the user for both logical names.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    The <CODE>M3TPROC</CODE> program computes time-aggregation for
    selected <A HREF = "VBLE.html#variables">variables</A> from 
    <A HREF = "VBLE.html#timestruct">time-stepped</A> I/O API files
    of types
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary"> BOUNDARY</A> ,
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom"> CUSTOM</A> , or
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRIDDED</A>.
    For each output time step for each selected variable, the program
    writes the selected aggregate value of that variable to the output
    file, optionally renaming it in the process.  For example, the program 
    allows you to construct a file of daily gridded 08:00-16:00-maximum 
    ozone selected from a standard AQM-output concentration file.
    <P> 

    Modified November,&nbsp;2002:  the previous edition would silently
    generate garbage for variables of type <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> or
    <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, or for files not of the types listed above.
    The new version handles all three types of variables correctly,
    and generates meaniangful error messages for the inappropriate
    file types.
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
    names of both the input and output files, according to EDSS/Models-3 
    conventions, using the operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;value&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    The program also uses the following optional 
    <STRONG>environment variables</STRONG> for control of the aggregation 
    operation to be performed:
    <UL>
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_ALLV</STRONG> (Y or N) indicates that the time
         aggregation is to be applied to all variables in the file,
         rather than a user-selected subset.
    <!--
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_PLEN</STRONG>  period length (HHMMSS), time step for
         the output file
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_BDATE</STRONG> starting date (YYYYDDD or YYYYMMSS) for 
         the first aggregation window
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_BTIME</STRONG> starting time (HHMMSS) for the first
         aggregation window
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_WLEN</STRONG> duration (HHMMSS) of the aggregation
         windows
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_NPER</STRONG> number of output time steps
    -->
    <LI> <STRONG>M3TPROC_TYPE</STRONG> aggregation type:
         <UL>
             <LI>  <STRONG>1</STRONG>  for sum over time window
             <LI>  <STRONG>2</STRONG>  for average over time window
             <LI>  <STRONG>3</STRONG>  for maximum over time window
         </UL>
</UL>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for any control
    options not set by environment variables:  the logical names you
    have chosen for the input and output files, and then extensively 
    for the options to choose; the prompts will have default responses
    which  can be accepted by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The
    specification of  starting date and time, duration, and aggregation
    time period  specifications follow EDSS/Models-3
    <A HREF = "DATETIME.html">  date and time conventions</A>.
    <P>

    Note that the set of aggregations which can be performed by one
    execution of M3TPROC is quite complex, being dependent upon the
    variables and other structures in the file being analyzed, as well
    as the aggregation specifications. If you want to run this program
    in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG>  (i.e., from a script), the
    recommended way to develop the script is to  run the program once
    interactively while noting the pattern of responses  to prompts
    which generate the particular analysis you want.  The  pattern of
    responses then becomes either a command-input file which  is
    redirected into the program's execution by the script, or becomes 
    a &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.  The following 
    is an excerpt of a script which computes daily 4 AM - 4 PM OZONE
    averages in <VAR>/tmp/myfile.A</VAR>, using the here-document
    approach:
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv FOO  /tmp/hourfile.A         !  input file
    setenv BAR  /tmp/maxfile.A          !  output file
    setenv M3TPROC_ALLV F               !  all variables:  false
    setenv M3TPROC_TYPE         2       !  agg type:  AVERAGE
    m3tproc  FOO BAR &lt;&lt;  !DONE
    OZONE                               !  variable to be aggregated
                                        !  do not rename OZONE
!DONE
    ...
