<H1>    Program M3EDHDR </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;     &lt;path name&gt;
    m3edhdr [&lt;infile&gt;&gt;]
    &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> 
    logical name </A> of the input file whose header attributes 
    are to be edited.  If <VAR>infile</VAR> is not present, the 
    program will prompt the user for the input file logical name.
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    Program M3EDHDR allows the user to edit various attributes in 
    Models-3 I/O API file headers.  Certain other edits, which would
    destroy the integrity of the file's internal metadata, are not 
    allowed.  The following table describes the supported edits, 
    (in terms of the names for file attributes as specified in the 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">FDESC3.EXT</A> include-file):
    <UL>
        <LI>  <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz">Horizontal coordinate 
                system</A> parameters, provided that the coordinate
                system is not a lat-lon coordinate system:

                <LI>  angle P_ALP3D
                <LI>  angle P_BET3D (except for UTM coordinate systems)

<P> 

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
    names of both the input file and the report file (if any), according 
    to Models-3 conventions, using the operation 
<PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
</PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical name you
    have chosen for the input file, and then extensively for the options 
    to choose; the prompts will have default responses which can be 
    accepted by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  (Note that the default
    responses are in fact the values taken from the file itself, so 
    that default behavior is not to change the attributes.)
<P> 

    Note that the set of edits which can be performed by one execution
    of M3EDHDR is quite complex, being dependent upon the variables and
    other structures in the file being analyzed.  If you want to run this 
    program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> (i.e., from a script), the 
    recommended way to develop the script is to run the program once 
    interactively while noting the pattern of responses to prompts which 
    generate the particular analysis you want.  The pattern of responses 
    then becomes either a command-input file which is redirected into the 
    program's execution by the script, or becomes a &quot;here-document&quot; 
    fed into the execution.
