<H1>    Program M3DIFF </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
setenv  &lt;infile A&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
setenv  &lt;infile B&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
setenv  &lt;reportfile&gt; &lt;path name&gt;
m3diff [&lt;infile A&gt; &lt;infile B&gt; [&lt;reportfile&gt;]] [&lt;DEFAULT&gt;
    &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>

where <VAR>infile A </VAR> and <VAR>infile B </VAR> are the 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input files, 
and <VAR>reportfile</VAR> is the logical name of the report file
(to which the statistical comparisoon report is printed).  
If <VAR>reportfile</VAR> is not present, the report will go either to the 
<A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> log file </A> (if it is set) or 
to the screen.  If neither is present, the program will prompt the
user for both input file and report file logical names.  If DEFAULT
is the last command-line argument, then <VAR>m3diff</VAR> does the
default statistical analysis.
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

The <CODE>M3DIFF</CODE> program performs <STRONG>
<A HREF="GRIDOPS.html">
the standard binary grid-comparison operations</A> on pairs of <A HREF =
"VBLE.html"> variables</A>  from a user-specified pair of
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRIDDED </A>
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary"> BOUNDARY </A>, or
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom"> CUSTOM </A>
I/O&nbsp;API files(say &quot;<VAR>infile A</VAR>&quot; and 
&quot;<VAR>infile B</VAR>&quot;), computes statistics for each 
specified variable and for the specified &quot;difference&quot; 
operation-- there being <A HREF = "GRIDOPS.html#ops"> 
about twenty notions of difference </A> supported, and optionally
generate an output file containing all the results of the specified
operations.  The analysis may be either the default comparison or a 
user-customized one; statistical analyses of the results are written 
to a report file; optionally, the gridded results themselves are 
written to an output file (under user-customized output variable names, 
etc.). The files must use the same <A HREF = "GRIDS.html"> grid </A> 
in order for the program to perform the comparison operations.  
<P> 

<EM>Note that file B can be the same as file A;</EM> this allows 
you to compute the ratio of variables O3 and NO2, for example, or 
the difference of NO2 between two successive hours or days within 
a single file.  Note also that M3DIFF requires that the file types
and their grid dimensions must match.
<P> 

By <STRONG>default</STRONG>, the program finds the set of variables 
which occur in both files, the common-denominator time step, and for 
each common time step, starting at the beginning of both files, for 
each common variable reports statistics for file-A, file-B, 
and for the result of the operation <CODE> A - B </CODE>.  In the 
most frequently expected application, both files will have the same
timestep, duration, starting date and time, and set of variables; 
<CODE>M3DIFF</CODE> will then compare all variables from both files
for all time steps.  In a more extreme example, if file A is 
time-independent with variables V and W, file B is time dependent
starting at (1988200,000000) with variables R, S, T, U, and V, then
by default <CODE>M3DIFF</CODE> would compare V from file A with 
V for (1988200,000000) from file B.
<P> 

In a <STRONG>customized comparison</STRONG> report, the user selects 
the duration, starting date, and starting time for the period to be 
analyzed, and a set of (up to 120 of) the following:
<UL>
    <LI>  variable from file A; 
    <LI>  variable from file B; 
    <LI>  <A HREF = "GRIDOPS.html#ops"> comparison operation </A>
          to be performed;
    <LI>  (if the files are <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#timestruct"> 
          time-dependent </A>:)
          whether to loop through the data in the order 
          &quot;for each time step for each variable&quot; or 
          &quot;for each variable for each time step&quot;
</UL>
<P> 

<STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> to the physical file
names of both files, according to Models-3 conventions, using the 
operation 
<PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
</PRE>
<STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names you
have chosen for the input files, and then extensively for the options 
to choose; the prompts will have default responses which can be accepted 
by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of starting date and time, 
and duration for the analysis follow Models-3 
<A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
<P> 

Note that the set of analyses which can be performed by one execution
of M3DIFF is quite complex and context-dependent (being determined
by the files being compared).
If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
(from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
is redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
&quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.  The following 
is an excerpt of a script which does the default analysis on 
/tmp/myfile.A and /tmp/myfile.B, using the here-document approach:
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv FOO  /tmp/myfile.A
    setenv BAR  /tmp/myfile.B
    m3diff  &lt;&lt;  !DONE
    FOO
    BAR
    Yes, I want the default analysis
                 # use the default run length:  entire duration of the files
    !DONE
    ...
</PRE>
