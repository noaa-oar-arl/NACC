<H1>    Program M3XTRACT </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    m3xtract [&lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;]
        &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> and <VAR>outfile</VAR> are the 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input 
    and output files.  If they are not present, the program will 
    prompt the user for both input file and output file logical
    names.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    The <CODE>M3XTRACT</CODE> program extracts a selected subset of 
    <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A> and/or  
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert">layer or layers</A>  from the input
    file for a specified time period from one Models-3 file  and writes
    them  to a different Models-3 file, with optional renaming of the
    variables during the process.  <STRONG>Before you run the
    program,</STRONG>  you need to assign <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html">
    logical names </A>  to the physical file names of both files,
    according to Models-3  conventions, using the operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names
    you have chosen for the input files, and then extensively for the
    options  to choose; the prompts will have default responses which
    can be accepted  by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of
    starting date and time,  target date and time, and duration for the
    run follow Models-3  <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time
    conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
    is redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.
