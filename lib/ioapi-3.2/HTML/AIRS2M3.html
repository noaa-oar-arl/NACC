files.
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    The <CODE>AIRS2M3</CODE> program read pollutant monitor values
    from an AIRS AMP350 file, convert to PPM, and output the result
    to an I/O&nbsp;API &quot;observational-data&quot; file that can
    be manipulated with I/O&nbsp;API tool programs and that can be
    visualized (overlaying gridded data) with the
    <A HREF="EDSS/pave_doc/Pave.html">PAVE</A> visualization program.  
    <P>

    The AIRS data are in an ASCII format with station headers for each
    reporting air quality monitor station, and then one month's hourly
    time stepped data for a particular air pollutant.  The values are
    hourly averaged (and specified in terms of local time), and a
    <CODE>00</CODE> time flag represents the hour <CODE>00-01</CODE>.
    A user may wish to represent that data segment by the starting hour,
    the ending hour, or the hour-center for the observational time
    (this latter having much better properties for time-interpolation,
    or for comparison with same-time model output data).  In these
    cases, a shift of 0, 10000, or 3000 should be entered here for the
    &quot;time shift&quot;, respectively.  Starting dates, etc. will be
    specified in terms of (4-digit) calendar year, month, and day.
    <P>

    Since the input data is given with respect to local time at each
    monitoring site, and the output data is time stamped with respect
    to Greenwich Mean Time, there is an additional input &quot;time
    zone cross reference&quot; file.  This file has multiple list
    formatted lines (i.e. with fields on each line delimited by commas
    or whitespace (blanks or tabs)), where the first field is the FIPS
    state ID, the second field is the FIPS county ID or zero, and the
    third field is the time zone number (the effective offset from GMT,
    measured in hours; for example, Eastern Standard Time is zone 5). A
    line with a county field of zero means that all otherwise-unmatched
    counties in the indicated state have the corresponding time zone;
    both state and county fields of zero means that all otherwise
    unmatched state-county pairs have the corresponding time zone.
    <EM>This file must be sorted into increasing order by state ID
    and county ID.</EM>  A sample time zone cross reference file is
    <A HREF="TZONE_XREF.txt">available here</A>.
    <P>

    The program constructs two output files:
    <DL>
        <DT> <CODE><STRONG>AIRS_INDEX</STRONG></CODE>
        <DD>  &quot;station cross reference/index&quot;file that may
              be used to map numeric (FIPS-based) site ID's to the
              name, address, etc., for the respective monitoring
              stations.  This file is list formatted (comma delimited,
              with string-fields enclosed in single quotes) with the
              following fields:
              <OL>
                  <LI>  Site ID (<CODE>((IST*1000+ICTY)*10000)+ISITE</CODE>,
                        where <CODE>IST</CODE> is the FIPS state ID,
                        <CODE>ICTY</CODE> is the FIPS county ID, and
                        <CODE>ISITE</CODE> is the monitor ID)
                  <LI>  city name
                  <LI>  county name

    <P>

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG>  you need to assign <A
    HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A>  to the physical file
    names of all four files according to Models-3 conventions, using
    the <EM>csh/tcsh</EM> operation (or its <EM>sh/bash/ksh</EM>
    equivalent):
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names
    you have chosen for the input files, for the time step sequence to
    process, for the starting year, month, day, and hour, the duration
    (in hours), the time zone shift, and the name for the output
    variable.  The prompts have default responses indicated  in square
    brackets <CODE>[LIKE THIS]</CODE>, which can be accepted  by
    hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file
    which  you may redirect into the program in the script, or may
    become a  &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution by the
    script.  
    <P>
