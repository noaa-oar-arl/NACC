<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;synchfile&gt;  &lt;path name&gt; or &quot;NONE&quot;
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;     &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  GRIDDESC     &lt;path name&gt;
    
    [m3cple | m3interp] <EM>&lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;</EM>
</PRE>
where <VAR>infile</VAR>, <VAR>outfile</VAR>, and the optional 
<VAR>synchfile</VAR> are the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html">logical 
names </A> of the input and output files.  <VAR>GRIDDESC</VAR>
is needed only if <VAR>M3CPLE</VAR> is doing a grid-to-grid
interpolation rather than a copy operation.
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>


The <VAR>M3CPLE</VAR> program extracts all 
<A HREF = "VBLE.html">variables</A> for a specified time step sequence
from one I/O&nbsp;API file, <VAR>infile</VAR>, copies them or optionally
interpolates them bilinearly to a new grid, and writes them to a different
I/O&nbsp;API file,  <VAR>outfile</VAR>, under the optional control of a
<VAR>synchfile</VAR>.  Any combination of <A HREF="BUFFERED.html">physical
or virtual files</A> is supported.  The output time step sequence must
be a subsequence of the input file's time step sequence.
<P>

Note that <STRONG>repeated copy-operations may be used to concatenate
multiple files</STRONG> that have the same grid and set of variables:
for example, if <CODE>FILE1</CODE> has hourly data from 2018017:00 through
2018018:00 and <CODE>FILE2</CODE> has hourly data from 2018018:00 
through 2018019:00, a <VAR>M3CPLE</VAR> using <CODE>FILE2</CODE> as
<VAR>infile</VAR> and <CODE>FILE1</CODE> as <VAR>outfile</VAR> may be
used to copy the 2018018:01-2018019:00 data from <CODE>FILE2</CODE> to
<CODE>FILE1</CODE>.  Repeated runs of this sort may be used to construct
month-, year-, or even decade-long files from a (large) set of
single-day files.
<P>
 
Program <VAR>M3INTERP</VAR> acts like <VAR>M3CPLE</VAR> 
except that it uses <A HREF="INTERP3.html"><CODE>INTERP3()</CODE></A>
to extract a possibly-nonaligned time step sequence from the file,
rather than only a subsequence of time steps found in the file.
<P>
 
The normal use of <VAR>M3CPLE</VAR> with a <VAR>synchfile</VAR> is 
to fit into a system of coupled models exchanging data via the <A
HREF="BUFFERED.html#pvm">I/O&nbsp;API coupling mode</A>, and
extract/interpolate data either from a virtual file to a  physical
file, or vice versa.  Grid-to-grid interpolation is only available for
files of type <A HREF="DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRDDED3</A>; the copy
operation is available for files of type
<A HREF="DATATYPES.html#grdded">GRDDED3</A>,
<A HREF="DATATYPES.html#custom">CUSTOM3</A>,
<A HREF="DATATYPES.html#bndary">BNDARY3</A>; in any case, all the
variables must be of <A NAME = "DATATYPES.html#basic">basic data type
M3REAL</A>.
<P>

For interpolation to be meaningful, <STRONG>the output
resolution should be finer than the input resolution</STRONG>, else you
should not be using any interpolation, but rather should be using some
sort of aggregation  algorithm  (possibly using a matrix 
from program <A HREF = "MTXBUILD.html"><VAR>MTXBUILD</VAR></A> 
in conjunction with program <A HREF="MTXCPLE.html"><VAR>MTXCPLE</VAR></A>).
<P>

For the I/O&nbsp;API-3.2 or later, all grid-to-grid interpolations
involving <A HREF="GRIDS.html#horiz">I/O&nbsp;API supported map
projection types</A> are supported. For the I/O&nbsp;API-3.1 or earlier
versions of the program, the list of <STRONG>supported coordinate
system</STRONG> conversions for interpolation is the following:
<UL>
    <LI>  <CODE>&quot;SAME&quot;:  &lt;input coordinate system type&gt; = 
          &lt;output coordinate system type&gt;</CODE>
    <LI>  Lambert  to  Lambert (with different projection angles)
    <LI>  UTM  to UTM (w/ different zones)
    <LI>  POL  to POL (w/ different parameters)
    <LI>  EQM  to  EQM (w/ different parameters)
    <LI>  LL   to/from  LAM, UTM, POL, EQM, TRM, or ALB,
    <LI>  LAM  to/from  LL,  UTM, POL, EQM, TRM, or ALB,
    <LI>  UTM  to/from  LL,  LAM, POL, EQM, TRM, or ALB,
    <LI>  POL  to/from  LL,  LAM, UTM, EQM, TRM, or ALB,
    <LI>  EQM  to/from  LL,  LAM, UTM, EQM, TRM, or ALB,
    <LI>  TRM  to/from  LL,  LAM, UTM, POL, EQM, or ALB,
    <LI>  ALB  to/from  LL,  LAM, UTM, POL, TRM, or EQM.
</UL>
<P>

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> 
    you need to assign <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> 
    to the physical file names of both files and to the 
    <A HREF = "GRIDDESC.html">GRIDDESC file</A>, 
    according to Models-3 conventions, using the operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names
    you have chosen for the input files, for the output grid, and for
    the time step sequence to process.  To do a copy operation instead
    of a grid-to-grid interpolation, respond <CODE>SAME</CODE> to the
    prompt for output grid (the default response).  The prompts have
    default responses indicated  in square brackets <CODE>[LIKE
    THIS]</CODE>, which can be accepted  by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;. 
    The specification of starting date and time,  target date and time,
    and number of time step records for the run follow  Models-3
    <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
    you may redirect into the program in the script, or may become a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution by the script.
