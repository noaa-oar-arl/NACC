<H1>    FILES:  Variables, Layers, and Time Steps </H1>

All files manipulated by the I/O API have multiple
<A NAME = "variables"> <STRONG>variables</STRONG> </A>.
Variables are arrays of data values that have additional structure,
are referenced by name (character strings of length at most 16), and
have units-designations (also (character strings of length at most 16)
and text descriptions ((character strings of length at most 80).  For
storing and retrieving metadata, and for storing ID-tables, indexes,
etc. in structured datatypes (those requiring "all-variable"
<A HREF = "READ3.html"><CODE>READ3()</CODE></A> and
<A HREF = "WRITE3.html"><CODE>WRITE3()</CODE></A> operations) such as
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#iddata">ID-referenced</A>,
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#profil">vertical profile</A>, and
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#smatrx">sparse matrix</A>,
it is legal for the number of variables to be zero.  Variable-names
should <STRONG>begin with an (upper or lower case) alphabetic
character</STRONG> which may be <STRONG>followed by alphabetic,
numeric, or or the underscore character _.  Case is significant.
</STRONG> (netCDF also permits the &quot;minus&quot; and
&quot;period&quot; characters; however, these break the
construction of algebraic formulas, etc., in
<A HREF = "/EDSS/pave_doc/index.html">PAVE</A>
and other analysis and visualization packages, and should not be used.)
<P>

Names, units-designations, and text descriptions are stored in the
file-headers and may be accessed via the
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">FDESC data structures</A> after
a call to <A HREF = "DESC3.html"><CODE>DESC3()</CODE>.</A>  The reverse
procedure is used to create new files:  store the file's description in
the FDESC data structures, and then call
<A HREF = "OPEN3.html"><CODE>OPEN3()</CODE></A>.
<P>

<STRONG>For C programmers:</STRONG>  The <CODE>IOAPI_Cdesc3</CODE>
fields (<CODE>gdnam, upnam, execn, fdesc[], updsc[], vname[],
units[]</CODE>, and <CODE>vdesc[]</CODE> are
<STRONG>blank-padded</STRONG> character arrays (padded to a length of
<CODE>NAMLEN3=16</CODE> for name fields and <CODE>MXDLEN3=80</CODE> for
description variables), not null-terminated C strings. On the other
hand, file name and variable name <STRONG>arguments</STRONG> to
<CODE>read3c()</CODE>, <CODE>write3c()</CODE>, <CODE>interp3c()</CODE>,
and <CODE>xtract3c()</CODE> <STRONG>should be null-terminated</STRONG> C
strings.
<BR>
Fortran::C string-conversion routines <VAR><A HREF="CSTRINGS.html">fstr2cstr(),
name2cstr(), cstr2fstr()</A></VAR> are very useful for passing
character strings in a mixed-language programming situation.
<P>

Within a file, all the variables have the same dimensions,
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz"> horizontal coordinate system and
horizontal grid structure, </A> number of layers and
<A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert"> vertical grid structure, </A>
time step structure, and <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html"> type of
data structure,</A> although they may have different
<A NAME = "DATATYPES.html#basic"> <STRONG>basic data type</STRONG></A>.
<P>

There are three (or four)  kinds of <A NAME = "DATATYPES.html#basic">
<STRONG>basic data type</STRONG></A> which individual variables
may have, as indicated by the following &quot;magic number&quot;
parameters defined in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> PARMS3.EXT </A>,
and stored in the <CODE>VTYPE3D</CODE> arrays of <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">
FDESC3.EXT </A>:
<UL>
    <LI> <STRONG>M3INT</STRONG>  for (32-bit) integer variables
    <LI> <STRONG>M3INT8</STRONG> for (64-bit) integer variables
    <EM>(I/O&nbsp;API-3.2 oir later, only)</EM>
    <LI> <STRONG>M3REAL</STRONG> for real (single precision) variables
    <LI> <STRONG>M3DBLE</STRONG> for double precision variables
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Layers</STRONG> range from 1 to <CODE>NLAYS3D</CODE>, where
<CODE>NLAYS3D</CODE> is the attribute in <CODE>FDESC3</CODE> file
descriptions for the number of layers.  <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert">
Vertical coordinate and vertical grid descriptions </A> found in
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC data structures </A>
fully characterize the layering structure of files, at least
for the standard set of vertical coordinate types.
<P>

There are also three kinds of
<A NAME = "timestruct"><STRONG>time-step structure</STRONG></A>
supported, discriminated on the basis of the time step <CODE>TSTEP3D</CODE>,
and stored according to
<A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> Models-3 date and time conventions</A>, and
found in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC file descriptions </A>.
These kinds of time step structure are:
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>Time-independent</STRONG>.  The file's time-step
    attribute is set to zero.
    Routines which deal with time-independent files ignore the date
    and time arguments.

    <LI>  <STRONG>Time-stepped</STRONG>.  The file has a starting date,
    a starting time,
    and a positive time step.  Read and write requests must be for
    some positive integer multiple of the time step from the starting
    date and time, or they will fail.

    <LI>  <STRONG>Circular-buffer</STRONG>.  The file keeps only two
    &quot;records&quot;, the &quot;even&quot; part and the
    &quot;odd&quot; part (useful, for example, for &quot;restart&quot; files
    where you're only interested in the last good data in the file).
    The file's description has a starting date, a starting time, and
    a negative time step (set to the negative of the actual time step);
    read and write requests must be for some positive integer multiple
    of the time step from the starting date and time -- and must be for
    a time step actually present -- or they will fail.
</UL><P>

There are eight <STRONG>types of data structure</STRONG> currently supported
by the I/O API.  Data structure type is indicated by
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; values </A>
for <CODE>FTYPE3D</CODE> in file descriptions such as those found in
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT. </A>  Definitions for
these magic numbers are found in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">
PARMS3.EXT </A>.  The data types, together with the names of the magic
numbers, are:
<UL>
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom">
          <STRONG>CUSTOM3</STRONG>: custom
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#dctnry">
          <STRONG>DCTNRY3</STRONG>: dictionary
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded">
          <STRONG>GRDDED3</STRONG>: gridded
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary">
          <STRONG>BNDARY3</STRONG>: boundary
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#iddata">
          <STRONG>IDDATA3</STRONG>: ID-referenced
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#profil">
          <STRONG>PROFIL3</STRONG>: vertical profile
          </A>,
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grnest">
          <STRONG>GRNEST3</STRONG>: nested grid
          </A>, and
    <LI>  <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#smatrx">
          <STRONG>SMATRX3</STRONG>: sparse matrix
