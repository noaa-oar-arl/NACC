    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    If you run into troubles with I/O&nbsp;API related programs, it is
    useful to know the versions of all the software components.  The
    CVS-related program <VAR>ident</VAR> can report to you versioning
    keywords in the various components of (binary) object, library, or
    executable files. For example, I can run the following sequence of
    commands on my desktop machine to find out the versioning
    information of various binary components:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% cd $HOME/apps/$BIN
% ident init3.o
    &mdash;reports the INIT3 version:  init3.F 87 2015-01-07 17:37:58Z coats
% ident libioapi.a
    &mdash;reports the INIT3 and M3UTILIO versions
% ident m3stat
    &mdash;reports the INIT3, M3UTILIO, and netCDF versions
    </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    Each I/O&nbsp;API source file will have its version embedded in the file's
    header-comment, e.g.

    This is probably the result of compiling either the library or
    the model (or both) for a different processor-model than you are
    running it on.
    <P>

    Starting with the Pentium II processor (1997), successive
    generations of Intel processors have introduced more and more
    powerful vector-style instructions (<CODE>MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3,
    SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, ...</CODE>) that can
    substantially speed up array-style calculations (including,
    particularly, the I/O&nbsp;API <CODE>INTERP3()</CODE>).    Note that
    each processor generation does support all the previous generations
    of instructions (but not, of course, vice versa).   
    <P> 
    
    Well designed modeling codes will get approximately a 20-25%
    performance boost for using SSE4.2 instructions, a further 70-80%
    boost for AVX, and a further 25-30% for AVX2.  Because of its sloppy
    coding, WRF will get less than half that much speedup, and CMAQ even
    less than that (due to the fact that these codes are so bottlenecked
    by main-memory operations that improving the arithmetic doesn't help
    much) . Note that Intel and AMD have also improved the memory
    systems of the various processor generations, giving a further 5-10%
    performance boost per processor generation for that reason
    (independent of which instruction set you're using). In fact, the
    degree of speedup is a good measure of how well array based
    calculations are coded:  good CFD applications will typically get an
    <CODE>AVX</CODE> speedup factor of about 1.8, whereas the (more
    poorly-coded) WRF gets only about 1.3 (which can be improved
    substantially by re-coding the advection and diffusion routines to
    be less memory-system-hostile).
    <P>

    See <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions</A>
    and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions</A> for
    more information about the SSE and AVX families of new instructions.
    <P>
    
    On a Linux system, you can see what instructions are supported by
    running the following at the command line
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    and then looking at the <CODE>flags</CODE> sections for the
    instructions listed below.
    <P>
    
    Use of these instructions is typically governed by command-line
    directives given to the compiler; different compilers use different
    flags to govern this, and have different defaults.  GNU and Intel
    compilers typically default to <CODE>SSE3</CODE>; PGI compilers
    typically default to the instruction set for the processor on which
    the compiler itself is being run.  See your compiler's documentation
    on how to control this.  Some examples are:

               This is only relevant for users at NCEP, where local

               on their systems.  <VAR>libnotcdf.a</VAR>  is a
               library that satisfies linker references to
               <VAR>libnetcdf.a</VAR> with &quot;stub&quot; routines
               that merely report that the user is trying to use

               native-binary file mode.

               on my SGI?&quot;
               <P>
               There is a problem with SGI&nbsp;<VAR>f90</VAR>
               Version&nbsp;7.4 and initialization of <CODE>COMMON</CODE>
               blocks.  The Fortran language standard specifies that
               <CODE>COMMON</CODE> blocks must be initialized by
               <CODE>BLOCK DATA</CODE> subprograms, but (since the
               actual operations of compiling and linking are not
               covered by the language standard, which considers them
               &quot;implementation details&quot;) does not specify
               just how to ensure that the <CODE>BLOCK&nbsp;DATA</CODE>
               subprogram is linked in with the rest of the executable.
               Usual and customary industry practice is that the use
               of a statement
               <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
               EXTERNAL FOOBLOCK
               </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
               in either the main program or in other subroutines that
               are called should ensure that <CODE>BLOCK&nbsp;DATA&nbsp;FOOBLOCK</CODE>
               is linked into the final executable.  This does not
               happen with SGI &nbsp;<VAR>f90</VAR> Version&nbsp;7.4,
               even in very simple test cases.
               Note that <CODE>BLOCK&nbsp;DATA&nbsp;INITBLK3</CODE> is needed to
               initialize I/O&nbsp;API internal data structures,
               including the unit number for <CODE>LOGFILE</CODE> and
               the number of I/O&nbsp;API files currently open;
               fortuitously, the latter seems to be initialized to zero
               (which is correct); the former is not initialized
               correctly, leading to failures to open and use a
               <CODE>LOGFILE</CODE> when you try to specify one.
               <P>
               Note that this error does not seem to happen with

               I have submitted this problem to SGI in an error
               report.  Their reply is to suggest the use of
               <U>non-standard</U>
               <CODE>CALL&nbsp;DATA&nbsp;INITBLK3</CODE>, which would

               This probably means that you are using a version of the

               "NEWSTUFF.html#taskp"> OpenMP parallel</A> usage, but
               have not activated the system parallel libraries in your
               model's build procedure.  For Intel compilers this means
               that you need to add <CODE>-openmp</CODE> (for
               compiler-version 15 or earlier) or <CODE>-qopenmp</CODE>
               (for compiler-version 16 or later); for GNU compilers,
               <CODE>-fopenmp</CODE>, and for PGI compilers,
               <CODE>-mp</CODE>. See the variable <CODE>OMPLIBS</CODE>
               defined in your machine/compiler's

         <LI>  &quot;Why are my program log and my Fortran-style files

               <P>
               On some systems (notably Sun and SGI), there are
               incompatibilities in run-time libraries between
               <CODE>f77</CODE> and <CODE>f90</CODE>. The upshot is that
               on these systems, you can link  together Fortran-77 and C
               using <CODE>f77</CODE>,  or Fortran-90  and C using
               <CODE>f90</CODE>, but you can't link together Fortran-77
               and Fortran-90. The default I/O&nbsp;API distribution for
               I/O&nbsp;API-3.0 or later is built using <CODE>f90</CODE>
               and runs into this problem when your model code is built
               using <CODE>f77</CODE>.  The  solution is to rebuild the

         <LI>  &quot;My program does a <CODE>segmentation fault</CODE>
               on the <CODE>OPEN3</CODE> call when I attempt to create a
               new file!&quot;
               <P>
               Probably the file description was not completely filled
               in.  This has been observed, for example, when one of
               the variable names <CODE>VNAME3D(I)</CODE> in
               <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> was not set correctly.  (What
               actually happens is that the <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> data
               structures are initialized to zero by the linker; then
               the netCDF internals don't handle strings that contain
               just ASCII zeros correctly).

               <P>
               Probably the file wasn't shut correctly.  (Unless
               you've declared a file &quot;volatile&quot; by
               <CODE>setenv&nbsp;&lt;file&gt;&nbsp;&lt;path&gt;&nbsp;-v</CODE>,
               netCDF doesn't update the file header until you call
               <CODE>SHUT3()</CODE> or <CODE>M3EXIT()</CODE>.)
               <P>

         <LI>  &quot;The log says <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> could not open the file,

                    <LI> The program is opening the file with mode
                         <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, which means that the file

                         by <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE>), but the file actually
                         <U>does</U> exist.<BR>
                         Delete the file and re-run.
                    <LI> The script which ran your program
                         failed to execute correctly the

                         for the file.  Try using the <VAR>env</VAR>
                         command in the script before you run the
                         program, in order to get started debugging your
                         script, and then check the value of the
                         problem-file's logical name.

         <LI>  &quot;Why does the linker say <CODE>ncabor_</CODE>

               There are four probable causes we've been observing:

                         There are now two separate libraries (with the
                         Fortran and the C parts of netCDF); you now
                         need libraries-flags

                         Netcdf-Fortran-4.4 and later seem to have
                         dropped the older <CODE>CALL NC*()</CODE>
                         interfaces in favor of the more recent 
                         <CODE>IERR=NF_*()</CODE> ones.  I/O&nbsp;API
                         Version&nbsp;3.2 has been tediously recoded to

                         newer ones, so you need to either use that, or
                         use an older netCDF version.

                   <LI>  <STRONG>Link command-line order:</STRONG><P>
                         Probably, the command line that links your
                         program has <CODE>-lnetcdf</CODE>
                         <EM><B>before</B></EM> <CODE>-lioapi</CODE>
                         instead of after.  (Most UNIX linkers only try
                         to resolve things in terms of libraries yet to
                         be defined, and don't go backwards.  E.g., if
                         you have
                         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                         !!!  INCORRECT !!! f90 -o foo foo.o ...
                         -lnetcdf -lioapi
                         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
                         the linker
                         won't know where to go to find netCDF
                         functions that are called in the I/O&nbsp;API;
                         instead, if you use
                         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                         !! CORRECT: f90 -o foo foo.o ... -lioapi -lnetcdf
                         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
                         then
                         the linker will scan &quot;-lnetcdf&quot; to
                         find  functions called in &quot;-lioapi&quot;
                         <P> Another possibility is that you are doing
                         <EM><B>multilingual programming</B></EM>, and
                         using maybe &quot;cc&quot; or  &quot;g++&quot;
                         or something else to do the link step. If so,
                         you need to explicitly list the libraries that
                         <VAR>f90</VAR> would include.  The list of these is vendor
                         dependent but frequently looks something like
                         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                         ... -lf90 -lU90 -lm
                         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
                         One way to find out is to try to use
                         the Fortrtan comp;iler in verbose mode, e.g.,
                         (<CODE>f90&nbsp;-v ...</CODE> on most UNIX
                         systems) to do the linking:  it may not find
                         the needed C++  libraries, but it will tell
                         you what libraries it needed for the Fortran
                         part of the I/O&nbsp;API and you can then
                         modify your original link command to use them.

                         underscores.  <EM>This will be a problem when
                         you use the Intel or Portland Group compilers
                         on  Linux systems that come with a
                         system-installed <CODE>libnetcdf.a</CODE>
                         (which will have been built with
                         <CODE>gcc/g77</CODE>).</EM>
                         <P>
                         The precise mangling behavior depends upon the
                         compiler, your system defaults file for the
                         compiler, and the compile/link command lines
                         themselves.  (It can also happen that
                         <VAR>netCDF</VAR> was built without the
                         expected Fortran or C++ support thay your
                         model was expecting. A useful UNIX utility for
                         diagnosing these problems is <VAR>nm</VAR>,
                         which reports what linker visible symbols are
                         present in binary executable, object
                         (<CODE>.o</CODE>), or library
                         (<CODE>.so</CODE>  and <CODE>.a</CODE>) files.
                         So if you see a linker error message like
                         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                         symbol foo_ not found (referenced in bar.o)
                         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
                         then do the following sorts of things:
                         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                         nm foo.o | grep -i foo<BR>

                         to try to find which program-component has the
                         differently-mangled symbol that the linker
                         needs.  Then go back and review the compiler
                         flags used in the  build-process for that

                         Sometimes you'll find that the missing
                         symbol was in a system routine that the

                         (maybe bad compiler-installation) didn't.
                         That one happened to me earlier this week
                         (as I write this May&nbsp;3, 2002) on an HP

         <LI>  &quot;PAVE reports bad values -- -9.xxE37 or something!&quot;
               <P>
               This is a PAVE bug, not an I/O&nbsp;API bug:  the original
               person who wrote the file-reader for PAVE couldn't be
               bothered to use the I/O&nbsp;API, but instead used raw
               netCDF reads without proper data-structure and error
               checking.  NetCDF fills in &quot;holes&quot; in its files
               with a particular fill-value that you are seeing, and this
               is an indication that the data for that variable and time
               step was never written to the file.  This happens, for
               example, at the starting time for an <A HREF = "MCPL.html">
               MM5/MCPL</A> run, for some of the variables which aren't
               calculated until after the run is in progress.
               <P>
               This is fixed in Pave Version&nbsp;2 and later.
