<H2> Usage </H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
setenv  INFILEA   &lt;path name&gt;
setenv  INFILEB   &lt;path name&gt; or &quot;SAME&quot;
setenv  REPORT    &lt;path name&gt; or &quot;LOG&quot;
mpasdiff  &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>

    where <VAR>INFILEA</VAR> and <VAR>INFILEB</VAR> are the 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html">logical names</A> of the input 
    MPAS-format-netCDF files, 
    and <VAR>REPORT</VAR> is the logical name of the report file
    (to which the statistical comparisoon report is printed).  
    If <VAR>INFILEB</VAR> is <CODE>SAME</CODE>, then the differences
    will be for (slices of) variables within the same file; if 
    <VAR>REPORT</VAR> is <CODE>LOG</CODE>, then the statistics-report
    will be written to standard output (or the program log).

<H2> Summary </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The <CODE>MPASDIFF</CODE> program performs <STRONG>
    <A HREF="GRIDOPS.html"> the standard binary grid-comparison
    operations</A></STRONG> on pairs of variables or layer-ranges of
    variables from a user-specified pair of MPAS_format-netCDF files
    <VAR>INFILEA</VAR> and <VAR>INFILEB</VAR>, computes statistics 
    (mean, sigma, max and its location, min and its location) for each 
    specified variable and for the specified &quot;difference&quot; 
    operation and write the statistical result to the program-log or to
    a specified ASCII <VAR>REPORT</VAR> file.
    <BR>
    <EM>
    Note that the program displays the variables by name-and-number,
    then requests them by number rather than by name.  It will at least
    give you a numbered menu, in any case; however, you may also want to
    look at output for the following commands to see in advance what the
    variables are:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    ncdump -h ${INFILA}<BR>
    ncdump -h ${INFILB}
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    </EM>
    <P> 

    The spatial dimensions of the (layer-ranges of) variables must be 
    the same &mdash; one may not compare a vertex-subscripted variable with a
    cell-subscripted variable nor a single-layer variable with a
    50-layer variable.  Likewise, the time-step ranges for the
    two variables must have the same number of records. However,
    <UL>
        <LI>  one may compare a time independent variable with a time
              stepped variable of the same dimensionality; the result
              will be a time stepped comparison.
        <LI>  if <VAR>INFILEA</VAR> and <VAR>INFILEB</VAR> both have
              1-hour time steps, but for different ranges of dates,
              one may compare <CODE>N</CODE> days (<CODE>24*N</CODE>
              time steps) of data from <VAR>INFILEA</VAR> with a 
              different <CODE>N</CODE> days of data from <VAR>INFILEB</VAR>
        <LI>  one may compare a specified layer (e.g., layer-1) of a
              layered (3-D) variable with a non-layered (2D) variable of
              the same dimensionality; the result will be a non-layered
              comparison;
        <LI>  one may even compare two specified layers (e.g., layer-1
              and layer-2) or layer ranges (e.g., layers 1-3 and 5-7)
              the same or a different 3-D variable, or two different
              time steps of the same variable...
        <LI>  one may compare vertex- or edge-subscripted variables,
              or variables whose vertical dimension is different from
              <CODE>nVertLevels</CODE> or <CODE>nVertLevelsP1</CODE>
              &mdash; e.g., <CODE>nEmisLevels</CODE> &mdash; unlike
              certain other unnecessarily-brittle A&amp;V packages.

    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the variable-names,
    and (as appropriate) for the starting and ending date&time for the
    report period, and for the  layer ranges for the variables.
    <P>

    Note that the set of analyses which can be performed by one
    execution is quite complex and context-dependent (being determined
    by the files and variaaables being compared).  If you want to run
    this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG>  (from a script), the
    recommended way to develop the script is to  run the program once
    interactively noting the pattern of responses  to prompts which
    generate the particular analysis you want.  The  pattern of
    responses then becomes either a command-input file which  is
    redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.  The following  is
    an excerpt of a script which does an analysis on  two variables (the
    first one time stepped 2-D from <VAR>INFILEA</VAR>, the second time
    independent 3-D from <VAR>INFILEB</VAR>, examining layer 4), from
    <VAR>/tmp/myfile.A</VAR> and <VAR>/tmp/myfile.B</VAR>, using the
    here-document approach:
    <PRE>
...
setenv INFILEA  /tmp/myfile.A.nc
setenv INFILEB  /tmp/myfile.B.nc
setenv REPORT   /tmp/myfile.A-B.txt
mpasdiff &lt;&lt;  !DONE
43              # use variable-43 from INFILEA
                # use default starting date for this variable
                # use default starting time for this variable
                # use default   ending date for this variable
                # use default   ending time for this variable
47              # use variable-47 from INFILEB
4               # use layer-4 as the starting layer for this variable
4               # use layer-4 as the   ending layer for this variable
1               # use difference (A - B) as the comparison-operation
!DONE
