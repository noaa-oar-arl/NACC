<H1>    Program M3TSHIFT </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    m3tshift [&lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;]
        &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> and <VAR>outfile</VAR> are the
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input and
    output files.  If they are not present, the program will prompt
    the user for both input file and output file logical names.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    The <CODE>M3TSHIFT</CODE> program copies selected time period from one
    Models-3 file to a different time period in a different Models-3 file.
    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> to the physical file
    names of both files, according to Models-3 conventions, using the 
    operation 
    <PRE>
        &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names you
    have chosen for the input files, and then extensively for the options 
    to choose; the prompts will have default responses which can be accepted 
    by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of starting date and time, 
    target date and time, and duration for the run follow Models-3 
    <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
    is redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.  The following 
    is an excerpt of a script which does the default analysis on 
    <CODE>/tmp/myfile.A</CODE> and <CODE>/tmp/myfile.B,</CODE> using
    the here-document approach:
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv FOO  /tmp/myfile.A
    setenv BAR  /tmp/myfile.B
    m3tshift  &lt;&lt;  !DONE
    FOO
    BAR
                 # use default starting date (obtained from the file header)
                 # use default starting time (obtained from the file header)
    2005200      # target date
    0            # target time
                 # use the default run length:  entire duration of FOO
!DONE
    ...
</PRE>
