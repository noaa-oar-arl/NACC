</A></H2>

    Conceptually, MCPL() is a drop-in MM5 output module designed for
    coupling MM5 to other environmental models, using the 
    <A HREF = "index.html">EDSS/Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</A>.  
    It fits into MM5 as a subroutine called every output  time step by
    the MM5v2 driver or from the SOLVE routine.   It can either be
    called every simulation-hour, as is traditional for MM5 output, or
    more  frequently&nbsp;-- even as frequently as every MM5
    advection-step where appropriate for model coupling purposes.  It
    is a netCDF generalization of MM5's OUTTAP() module, and serves as
    a replacement for most of the functionality of the EPA/NCSC MCIP 
    program(s) used to interface MM5 to air quality models.   It also
    absorbs much INTERP functionality, since it can optionally also
    produce pressure level interpolated output files.  For each  MM5
    domain, it can optionally produce one or many output grids fitting
    inside it.  These output grids may either be the entire MM5 domain
    or any proper window into it, and may each have its own output
    time-step.  (NOTE that some output variables&nbsp;--
    decoupled wind components, wind speed, divergence, or vorticity&nbsp;--
    are only available on proper windows into the MM5 domains (since 
    the first and last horizontal rows and columns fo dot-points don't
    have PSTAR-values available to do the necessary decoupling).
    Air-quality boundary files are only available if the output grid is
    a proper window into the MM5 domain, as well.  Some other
    variables  are available only if the corresponding MM5 physics
    options are chosen.)   
    <P>
    
    MCPL() has a relatively trivial effect upon MM5 performance.  
    Profiling of a 24-hour continental North America 45-kilometer
    MM5 run on an IBM SP showed a total CPU time of 15,000 seconds, 
    of which 30.5 seconds was spent inside MCPL.  Normal
    run-to-run CPU-time variability on this machine is an order of
    magnitude larger than the time spent in MCPL, in fact.
    <P>
    
    When the MM5 Kain-Fritsch cloud package is active, MCPL also can 
    produce (heretofore-nonstandard) files which store the starting 
    conditions for Kain-Fritsch convective cloud events.  Data from 
    these files are then used (for example) by air quality models to
    reproduce exactly the scheduling and behavior of such convective 
    events.  <EM>This package is not part of the standard release;
    <A HREF = "mailto:carlie@jyarborough.com,john.mchenry@baronams.com">please
    contact the MCPL authors</A> for access to it.</EM>
    <P>
    
    For each MM5 domain, the user may select one or more output window
    grids.  For each requested output window, MCPL produces  
    <STRONG>any combination</STRONG> of the following twelve 
    time-independent and  time-stepped <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html">output 
    files</A> (which are
    <A HREF = "index.html">EDSS/Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</A>
    selective direct-access files, rather than being sequential
    Fortran binary (unformatted) files as are &quot;normal&quot; MM5
    outputs).  For the time-stepped output files, each output window 
    has its own starting date, starting time, and time step (with
    default values taken from the starting date, starting time, and
    <CODE>TAPFREQ</CODE> of the MM5 run).

    MCPL gives the user the choice of which variables to write to
    each of the standard files, out of a potential selection which includes 
    the &quot;standard&quot; MCPL-output variables for these files,
    the lists of <CODE>ADDR1</CODE> and <CODE>ADDR2</CODE> MM5-internal
    variables, and a selection of other variables used by, e.g., the
    TOPLATS hydrology model or the MAQSIP or Models-3 air quality model. 
    <P> 

    The MM5 MCPL/IO&nbsp;API Module also produces IO&nbsp;API-style
    grid description files, if these do not yet exist.  These are
    sequential formatted (ASCII) Fortran files containong grid and 
    coordinate system descriptions in EDSS/Models-3 IO&nbsp;API-compatible 
    terms.
    <P> 

    Module operation is as follows:  First, this module gets the output
    grid names from <A HREF = "mcpl.script.html#env">environment variable</A>
    <CODE>OUTGNAMES</CODE> (where grid name <CODE>&quot;NONE&quot;</CODE> 
    means that output for the grid is turned off); then definitions for 
    the AQM cross and dot point grids either from 
    <A HREF = "mcpl.script.html#env">environment variables</A> or the 
    <A HREF = "GRIDDESC.html">I/O&nbsp;API GRIDDESC</A>
    file, checks the defining parameters for the AQM dot-point grid,
    and  computes the parameters for the boundary structure.  If the 
    GRIDDESC file does not yet exist, it constructs it on the basis
    of user-supplied grid-descriptive inputs.  It also gets default 
    starting date, starting time, time step, and duration from MM5.
    <P>   
    
    Then, for each output grid, it gets the starting date, starting time, 
    and time step fron environment variables, constructs headers for the 
    output files requested by the user, and opens them.  The 
    variables-list for each of these files is selected by the user 
    from the complete set of potential output variables for that file,
    and communicated to the routine by way of a 
    <A HREF = "mcpl.script.html#gb2v">text file</A> containing the 
    requested-variables list for that file, formatted with one variable-name 
    per line.  
    <P>
    
    For each relevant time step, <CODE>MCPL()</CODE> copies/computes/re-orders 
    the relevant variables from MM5 internal data structures into 
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html">I/O&nbsp;API storage 
    order</A> in an internal buffer, and writes the result to the 
    appropriate output file.  Additionally if the MCPL-KF module is 
    activated, it detects the inception of each Kain-Fritsch convective 
    cloud event, and writes the starting date, time, duration and 
    starting meteorology data  for that cloud event to the KF-files
    for all the appropriate output grids.

    For some systems (Sun <VAR>f90</VAR>, recent SGI compilers, etc.),
    you will need to add additional qualifiers to <CODE>CPPFLAGS</CODE>
    in <VAR>configure.user</VAR>, in order for the compiler to process
    some of the following flags correctly.
    <P>
    
    <STRONG>For MM5V3</STRONG>, you should add the  preprocessor definition

    to access MM5V3 date conventions and file header data structures
    instead of the previous versions.
    <P>
    
    <STRONG>For the Benjamin-Miller sea level pressure algorithm</STRONG>, 
    you should  add the preprocessor definition 
    <STRONG><CODE>-DMCPL_BMP=1</CODE></STRONG> (or equivalent) to the
    <CODE>MM5/mcpl/Makefile</CODE> compile line for

    <STRONG><EM>NONHYDROSTATIC MM5!!</EM></STRONG>
    <P> 

    <STRONG><EM>DOES NOT WORK WITH DISTRIBUTED-MEMORY
    MM5!!</EM></STRONG><BR>
    We have looked at the software engineering task of making MCPL work
    with the distributed-memory version of MM5, but the task of doing a
    <STRONG>clean</STRONG> implementation of the necessary
    &quot;gathers&quot; of MM5 data from all of the machines where the
    data has been distributed into buffers from which MCPL can perform
    its calculations and write out the results looks to be exceedingly
    complex.  If you would like this capability, please be prepared to
    come to us with at least two man-years' funding.
    <P> 

    <STRONG><EM>OpenMP on SGI</EM></STRONG>:  When running with OpenMP
    parallelism under SGI IRIX6, the default per-thread stack and memory
    limits are inappropriately tiny.  This difficulty may be controlled
    by setting appropriate values for environment variables that control
    this behavior.  The following values work for us:
    <PRE>
    MP_SLAVE_STACKSIZE=32000000 &gt;or other reasonable limit&lt;
    MP_STACK_OVERFLOW=ON
    </PRE>
    <P> 

    <STRONG><EM>MM5V2, Historical Simulations, and Y2K-Related 
    Issues</EM></STRONG>  If <A HREF = "mcpl.script.html">your
    script</A> sets all of the date-related environment variables for
    MCPL() explicitly, you  should not encounter any Y2K-related
    problems.  However, with MM5V2 (which is itself not Y2K-compliant)
    if you use default MCPL starting dates (i.e., you have not done
    a <CODE>setenv&nbsp;MCPL_SDATE 
    &lt;date-list,&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;by&nbsp;output&nbsp;window&gt;
    </CODE>), MCPL attempts to fill in the century field by using the
    century value obtained from the current real-time wall
    clock/calendar.  <EM>With MM5V2, the default  behavior leads
    to errors when the simulation century and the  wall-clock century
    are not the same.</EM>   For example, if on March&nbsp;4, 2000,
    one is doing a historical MM5V2 simulation for July&nbsp;17, 1995, 
    the disparity between the run-time wall clock century and the
    simulation century leads MCPL in MM5V2 to think that the requested
    output dates will be for year 2095 (= century 2000 from the
    wall-clock + year 95 from MM5V2's <CODE>MDATE</CODE>).
    <P>
    
    For historical cases before 1&nbsp;AD, there may potentially be
    problems; the system has not been tested thoroughly for these,
    although I believe it will behave correctly (Fortran integer
    division involving negative numbers &quot;does the right
    thing&quot;, unlike C division which is undefined and allowed 
    by the C standard to vary from vendor to vendor).
    <P>

    <STRONG><EM>No MPI/MPP.</EM></STRONG>  MCPL follows a
    single-output-file model rather than a distributed-I/O model.  It
    therefore requires that the variables being output are already
    gathered into the global arrays pointed to by the pointers in MM5
    <CODE>COMMON</CODE>s, and that (for KF cloud-event data) the
    MCPL_KF sub-module be able to receive all of the KF event data and
    serialize it by means of  OpenMP critical sections.  Note that
    since MCPL was first developed for use in coupling MM5 with other
    environmental models, its structure is in part dictated by the
    requirements of those models. These other models may not be assumed
    to have exactly the same data decomposition as MM5 (or even to live
    on the same machine(s); it is perfectly reasonable to build a
    real-time forecast system coupling an MM5 running in RTP,NC with a
    hydrology model running at GA Tech and an air quality model running
    at UT-Austin).
    <P> 

    <STRONG>No Moving Nests.</STRONG>  This is an EDSS/Models-3
    I/O&nbsp;API requirement, since each file's grid definition is
    active for the entire life of the file.  <STRONG>Workaround:
    </STRONG> each domain instantiation should be treated as a distinct
    domain in MM5, and have its own set of output files, which
    have starting dates and times matching the time at  which the domain
    is activated.  Note that MCPL already turns off output for a domain
    at the time MM5 turns the domain off.
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Now completed:  </STRONG>Early versions may not have 
    been tested for all potential output variables, or all output files.  
    Variables needed by MAQSIP,  SMOKE, and TOPLATS have been validated.  
    Pressure-level files are currently undergoing test and validation.
    <P> 

    If MCPL_KF is used, and MM5 is run in parallel, <STRONG>you must use 
    the thread-safe version of the EDSS/Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API library</STRONG>.  
    <VAR>This is also true if you use the (currently-being-tested)
    multithreaded version of MCPL()</VAR>.

         <LI> The version current as of 1/22/2001
             includes minor bug-fixes of the code related to grid
             descriptions, an improved relative humidity calculation
             which does a linear transition between ice-based relative
             humidity formulation below 248.16&nbsp;K and a water-based
             humidity formulation above 268.16nbsp;K.
             <P>
       <LI> The version current as of 3/21/2000 includes minor bug-fixes,
             provision for using the Benjamin-Miller sea level pressure
             algorithm instead of the INTERP algorithm, and provision
             for putting out wind components (UX,VX) interpolated to
             cross-points to files MC2 and MC3.
             <P>
        <LI> The version current as of 10/18/1999
             includes minor bug-fixes, as well as adaptations for
             MM5V3, which may be activated by adding a CPP-definition
             for symbol MM5_V3 to the compilation-flags.  <STRONG>As
             of the current date, we believe the MM5V3 mods work correctly
             (they are relatively simple, and involve changes to treatment 
             of date-&amp;-time variables, and grid definitions taken from 
             the new file header structure), but they have not been tested,
             as we at NCSC are not yet running MM5V3 in production mode.
             With luck, that will happen during January 2000.</STRONG>
             <P>
        <LI> The version current as of 7/29/1999 comments out
             <CODE>IMPLICIT NONE</CODE> in <VAR>mcpl.F</VAR>
             and includes re-fixes for OpenMP parallelism and for MAQSIP
             cloud-type information.
             <P>
        <LI> Versions prior to 7/26/1999 <STRONG>still</STRONG> had 
             problems when compiled with OpenMP parallelism turned 
             on.  There was also a bug in file-header description
             of cloud parameterization, when MCPL was run with more
             than one output window per MM5-domain.
             <P>
        <LI> Versions prior to 7/21/1999 had problems when compiled
             with OpenMP parallelism turned on. 
             <P>
        <LI> This version includes a current snapshot of the EDSS/Models3 
             I/O&nbsp;API. A new release is expected in September, 1999.
             <P>
        <LI> The initial version is for MM5v2.x.  We will re-do for MM5v3
             as soon as we can.
             <P>
        <LI> If you get error messages about undeclared variables:
             remove the <CODE>IMPLICIT NONE</CODE> at the top of
             <VAR>mcpl.F</VAR>:  I have had so much trouble dealing
             with <CODE>IMPLICIT</CODE> source codes that I refuse to
             deal with them any more.  I've written versions of the 
             MM5 include-files which declare everything they define
             and I use them for my own private development.  Then I
             sometimes forget to delete the <CODE>IMPLICIT NONE</CODE> 
             when I prepare a new release.

    <H3>Notes</H3>

    Note that this released version does not include the KF package
    nor the modifications for two-way model coupling (which may vary
    from application to application, depending upon how many 
    data-dependency loops need to be closed up).  Users desiring versions
    with these (more-complex-to-install) capabilities should 
    <A HREF = "#authors">contact the authors</A>.  Due to Microsoft
    Internet Explorer's
    mis-implementation of the HTTP standard, you may need to use a 
    more-compliant browser such as 
    <A HREF = "http://www.opera.com/">Opera</A>, 
    <A HREF = "http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>, or 
    <A HREF = "http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</A> in order to download
    MCPL successfully.
    <P>
      
    In addition to the MCPL source, you will also need the 
    <A HREF = "http:index.html">EDSS/Models3
