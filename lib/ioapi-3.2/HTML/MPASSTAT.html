<H1>    Program MPASSTAT </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
setenv  INFILE    &lt;path name&gt;
setenv  REPORT    &lt;path name&gt; or &quot;LOG&quot;
mpasstat  &lt;and respond to the prompts&gt;
</PRE>

    where <VAR>INFILE</VAR> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html">logical
    name</A> of the input MPAS-format-netCDF file  and <VAR>REPORT</VAR>
    is the logical name of the report file (to which the statistical
    comparisoon report is printed).  If <VAR>REPORT</VAR> is
    <CODE>LOG</CODE>, then the statistics-report will be written to
    standard output (or the program log).
    <P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>


<H2> Summary </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The <CODE>MPASSTAT</CODE> program computes statistics (mean, sigma,
    max and its location, min and its location) for a specified variable
    or layer-range of a 3-D variable, and writes the statistical result
    to the program-log or to a specified ASCII <VAR>REPORT</VAR> file.
    <P>
    <EM>
    Note that the program refers to the variables by number rather than
    by name.  It will at least give you a numbered menu, in any case;
    however, you may also want to look at output of the following
    command to see in advance what the variables are:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    ncdump -h ${INFILE}
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    </EM>
    <P> 
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the variable-name,
    and (as appropriate) for the starting and ending date&time for the
    report period, and for the  layer range for the variable.
    <P> 
    
    Note that the set of analyses which can be performed by one
    execution is quite complex and context-dependent (being determined
    by the file being analyzed).  If you want to run this program in
    <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG>  (from a script), the recommended way to
    develop the script is to  run the program once interactively noting
    the pattern of responses  to prompts which generate the particular
    analysis you want.  The  pattern of responses then becomes either a
    command-input file which  is redirected into the program in the
    script, or becomes a  &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the
    execution.  The following  is an excerpt of a script which does an
    analysis on layers 4-7 of 3-D time stepped variable-43 from
    <VAR>/tmp/myfile.A</VAR>, with statistics written to the
    program-log, the time period being the entire duration of the file,
    using the here-document approach for the scripting:
    <PRE>
...
setenv INFILE   /tmp/myfile.A
setenv REPORT   LOG
mpasstat &lt;&lt;  !DONE
43              # use variable-43 from INFILEA
                # use default starting date for this variable
                # use default starting time for this variable
                # use default   ending date for this variable
                # use default   ending time for this variable
4               # use layer-4 as the starting layer for this variable
7               # use layer-4 as the   ending layer for this variable
!DONE
...
    </PRE>
    <P> 

    Note also that one may analyze vertex- or edge-subscripted variables,
    or variables whose vertical dimension is different from
    <CODE>nVertLevels</CODE> or <CODE>nVertLevelsP1</CODE> &mdash;
    e.g., <CODE>nEmisLevels</CODE> &mdash; unlike certain other
    unnecessarily-brittle A&amp;V packages.
