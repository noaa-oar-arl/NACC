<H1>    Dates and Time Conventions </H1>

Throughout the EDSS and Models-3 systems -- and particularly in the 
I/O API -- dates and times represent <STRONG>Greenwich Mean
Time.</STRONG>  Dates and times (and time-increments) are stored 
as integers, using the coding formats
<PRE>
    HHMMSS  = 10000 * hour  +  100 * minutes  +  seconds
    YYYYDDD =  1000 * year  +  day
</PRE>
where the year is 4-digits (1994, say, rather than just 94), and the 
day is the Julian day-number (1,...,365 or 366).
<P>

<EM><STRONG>Note</STRONG> that time intervals coded <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE>
will <STRONG>suffer <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>-overflow</STRONG> after a
little more than 24.5 years; however, for I/O&nbsp;API-3.1 or later,
a number of I/O&nbsp;API routines&mdash;<CODE>CURREC(), CURRSTEP(),
JSTEP3(), LASTTIME(), NEXTTIME()</CODE>&mdash;are carefully coded so as
to  avoid such overflow, and can be used for time periods as long as
several thousand years.  For I/O&nbsp;API files, <STRONG>the limiting factor is
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>-overflow</STRONG> for the number of records.  (For
files with a one-hour timestep, for example, this limits file-duration
to 89,478 years (which is sufficient for most applications:-).)</EM>
<P> 

A <STRONG>time step sequence</STRONG> is a sequence of dates and times
<PRE>
    { [date(0),time(0)], [date(1),time(1)], ... [date[N],time[N] }
</PRE>
having a starting date and time [date(0),time(0)], a time increment dT,
and such that each [date(K),time(K)] is exactly dT away from 
[date(K-1),time(K-1)]&mdash;for example, the following is a five-step
time step sequence starting at midnight January 2, 1980, with time step three hours:
<PRE>
    { 1980002:000000, 1980002:030000, 1980002:060000, 1980002:090000, 1980002:120000 }
</PRE>
Note that 
<A HREF = "VBLE.html#timestruct">each file has a time step
sequence</A> (where by convention, time increment <STRONG>dT=0 means
that the data in the file is time-independent,</STRONG> and routines
like <CODE>READ3()</CODE> and <CODE>WRITE3()</CODE> which deal  with
time-independent files ignore the  date-and-time arguments.  Note that
programs (e.g., <VAR>m3tools</VAR> programs) which control their run
timestep-sequence by specification of starting date&amp;time, timestep,
and ending date&amp;time are in practice not subject to
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>-overflow problems;  however, older ones controlled
by starting date&amp;time, timestep, and duration may well be subject to
the above-mentioned 24.5-year limit. Unfortunately, this requires an
incompatible interface-change to fix...
<P> 

<A NAME="stdday"><STRONG>Standard-Year</STRONG></A> and
<STRONG>Standard-Week</STRONG> files are files for climatological
and similar year-independent data.  For these files, 
<A HREF = "INTERP3.html"><VAR>INTERP3()</VAR></A> and possibly
<A HREF = "WKDAY.html"><VAR>WKDAY()</VAR></A> can be used to extract
data for dates and times for the relevant day of year 0 according to
the patterns
<PRE>
    ...
    !!  Standard-Year data:
    !!  Note:  Fortran MOD() doesn't work &quot;right&quot;
    !!  for negative numbers:

    IF ( JDATE .GT. 0 ) THEN
        DAY = MOD( JDATE, 1000 )
    ELSE
        YEAR = (-JDATE)/1000 + 1
        DAY  = MOD( JDATE + 1000*YEAR, 1000 )
    END IF
    IF ( .NOT.INTERP3(&lt;file&gt;, &lt;variable&gt;, DAY, JTIME, ... )
    ...
    !!  Standard-Week data:

    DAY = WKDAY( JDATE )
    IF ( .NOT.INTERP3(&lt;file&gt;, &lt;variable&gt;, DAY, JTIME, ... )
    ...
</PRE>
Standard-year files should cover a period at least from
Year&nbsp;1:Day&nbsp;1 and at least through Year&nbsp;1:Day&nbsp;366,
and standard-week files should cover a period at least from
Year&nbsp;1:Day&nbsp;1 and at least through Year&nbsp;1:Day&nbsp;8.
Note that for <EM>monthly</EM> data valid at the middle of the month,
the starting date should be something like Year&nbsp;(-1),
Day&nbsp;351, the time step 30.5 days (732 hours), and the ending date
Year&nbsp;1, Day&nbsp;16.
<P>

There are a number of utility routines available for manipulating dates 
and times, in addition to programs 
<A HREF = "GREGDATE.html"> <STRONG>gregdate</STRONG> </A> and
<A HREF = "JULDATE.html"> <STRONG>juldate</STRONG> </A> for
converting back and forth between model-convention Julian dates and
ordinary calendar dates.  
Note that for these utility routines, time increments may perfectly well
be negative -- just make sure you keep the parts all positive or all
negative; a time increment of  -33000  means to step three and a half 
hours into the past, for example; the hours part is -3, the minutes
part is -30, and the seconds part is 0.  This way of representing dates
and times is easy to understand and manipulate when you are watching code 
in the debugger (you don't have to turn the UNIXism 
&quot;seconds since Jan. 1, 1970&quot; 
into something meaningful for your model run, nor do you have to remember 
whether April has 30 days or 31 when your model run crosses over from 
April to May).
