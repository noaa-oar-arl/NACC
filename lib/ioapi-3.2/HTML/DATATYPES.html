<H1>    File and Data Types Supported by the I/O&nbsp;API </H1>

    There are eight <A HREF = "#struct"><STRONG>data-structure
    types</STRONG></A> and three  <A HREF = "#basic"><STRONG>basic
    data-types</STRONG></A> for <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A> in
    files presently supported by the I/O&nbsp;API.  The I/O&nbsp;API was
    designed so that this list of file types might be extended with
    relatively little effort.  The types are associated with file type
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; parameter
    values </A> which are defined in <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>-file <A HREF =
    "INCLUDE.html#parms"><CODE>PARMS3.EXT</CODE></A>. The current set of
    structure-ypes, together with the names of the magic number
    parameters, is given by the list below.  Note that declarations are
    given in terms of <CODE>REAL*4</CODE> and <CODE>REAL*8</CODE>; this
    will protect you if you do things like using precision-doubling
    software or <VAR>f90&nbsp;-r8&nbsp;...</VAR> compiler flags to force
    double precision calculations in your code and linking the wrong
    version of the low-level XDR data representation library by
    accident.  (If you don't do these things, using <CODE>REAL</CODE> in
    these declarations is quite all right.)

<H2> File (data structure) Types</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

    The list of file types, together with the magic numbers for each, is:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <A HREF = "#custom"> <STRONG>CUSTOM3</STRONG>:  custom </A>,
        <LI>  <A HREF = "#dctnry"> <STRONG>DCTNRY3</STRONG>:  dictionary </A>,

    </UL>
    The file's data structure type value is stored in the
    <CODE>FTYPE3D</CODE> variable of the file header and the file
    description data structures in
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"><CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE></A>.  Note that
    all the <A HREF = "VBLE.html">variables</A> in a file have the
    same structural data type, the same dimensionality and
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert">layer structure</A>, and the same
    <A HREF = "#timestruct">time step structure</A>, but possibly different
    <A HREF = "#basic">basic types</A>. The vast majority of air quality
    modeling files are of the gridded or boundary structural types of basic
    type <CODE>REAL</CODE>, which need only ordinary arrays to write from or
    read into.  For the other types, you will have to set up
    <CODE>COMMON</CODE>s as described below, to match the data structure for
    the variables in the file.

<H2> Variable (&quot'basic&quot;) Data Types</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

    Independent of data structure-types, there are three categories of <A
    NAME = "basic"> <STRONG>basic</STRONG> or <STRONG>underlying
    types</STRONG> </A> which each variable in the data records may have.
    Note that each variable has a basic type of its own; it is quite
    legitimate to have a gridded file with 5 gridded integer variables, 3
    gridded real variables, and 7 gridded double-precision variables. Basic
    data type for variables  is stored in the <CODE>VTYPE3D(:)</CODE> array
    of the file header and the file description data structures in
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"><CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE></A>.
    The list of data types, together with the &quot;magic numbers&quot;
    (chosen to be consistent with existing netCDF magic numbers)
    for each (defined consistently with netCDF usage, in INCLUDE-file
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> PARMS3.EXT </A>) is the following:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3INT:</STRONG>  <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> (4-byte integer,
        = netCDF <VAR>nf_int</VAR>)
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3REAL:</STRONG>  <CODE>REAL</CODE>  (single-precision,
        = netCDF <VAR>nf_float</VAR>)
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3DBLE:</STRONG>  <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> (at least
        8-byte, = netCDF <VAR>nf_double</VAR>)
    </UL>
    Additionally, I/O&nbsp;API
    <A HREF=MODNCFIO.html><CODE>MODULE&nbsp;MODNCFIO</CODE></A> and
    <A HREF=MODMPASFIO.html><CODE>MODULE&nbsp;MODMPASFIO</CODE></A>
    support high-level data access to variables in their respective
    file-types, which may also include variables of the following
    four types:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3BYTE:</STRONG>  <CODE>INTEGER*1</CODE> (1-byte integer,
        = netCDF <VAR>nf_byte</VAR>)
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3CHAR:</STRONG>  <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE>
        (= netCDF <VAR>nf_char</VAR>)
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3INT2:</STRONG>  <CODE>REAL</CODE>  (single-precision,
        = netCDF <VAR>nf_short = nf_int2</VAR>)
        <LI>  <STRONG>M3INT8:</STRONG>  <CODE>INTEGER*8</CODE> (at least 8-byte,
        = netCDF <VAR>nf_int64</VAR>)
    </UL>
    <P>

    Currently, only real variables are supported by routines
    <A HREF = "INTERP3.html"><CODE>INTERP3()</CODE></A> and
    <A HREF = "DDTVAR3.html"><CODE>DDTVAR3()</CODE></A>, and analysis program
    <A HREF = "M3STAT.html"><VAR>M3STAT</VAR></A> (before I/O&nbsp;API-3.2), and
    <A HREF = "M3DIFF.html"><VAR>M3DIFF</VAR></A>; only integer and real
    variables are supported for <A HREF = "BUFFERED.html">buffered
    virtual files</A>.

<H2> Time Step Structure</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

    Independent of data structure-types, there are also three categories of
    <A NAME = "timestruct"> <STRONG>time structure</STRONG> </A>
    for the data records, discriminated on the basis of the
    <CODE>TSTEP3D</CODE> attribute, and further specified by the starting
    date and time <CODE>SDATE3D</CODE> and <CODE>STIME3D</CODE>
    attributes in the file header and <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">FDESC</A>
    data structures.  Time step and starting date and time are stored
    according to <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> Models-3 time conventions </A>.
    Internally, the I/O&nbsp;API maintains the value of MXREC3D, the maximum
    time step record number, which describes &quot;how long&quot; the file
    is.  The categories of time step structure are:
    <UL>
        <LI> <STRONG>Time-independent.</STRONG>  <CODE>TSTEP3D = 0</CODE>,
             and <CODE>SDATE3D</CODE> and <CODE>STIME3D</CODE> are
             ignored.<BR>
             <CODE>MXREC3D</CODE> is either 0 (for an empty file)
             or 1.
        <LI> <STRONG>Time-stepped.</STRONG> <CODE>TSTEP3D &gt; 0</CODE>, and
             <CODE>SDATE3D:STIME3D</CODE>
             represent the starting date&time for the file's time step
             sequence.<BR>
             There are at most <CODE>MXREC3D</CODE> time steps in that sequence.
        <LI> <STRONG>Circular-buffer.</STRONG> <CODE>TSTEP3D &lt; 0</CODE> is
             the negative of the actual time step; the file keeps only two
             time steps of data, the &quot;even&quot; part and the
             &quot;odd&quot; part. <CODE>SDATE3D:STIME3D</CODE> represent
             the starting date&time for the file's time step sequence. 
             <BR>
             There are at most <CODE>MXREC3D</CODE> time steps in that
             sequence.
    </UL><P>

    Each of these data types supports multiple
    <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> time steps </A> of multiple
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#vert"> layers </A> of
    multiple user-defined <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variables </A>, as
    indicated below (a time step of a variable being all of the data
    values associated with the date and time of that time step.)

    </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2> On Compound Data Structure Types</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

    In some cases, there are additional system-defined variables which
    are part of the data structure (e.g., the
    <A HREF = "#iddata"><CODE>NUMIDS</CODE> in the ID-referenced-data data
    structure,</A> below).  Where such system-defined variables are
    present, the operations <A HREF = "READ3.html"><CODE>READ3()</CODE></A> and
    <A HREF = "WRITE3.html"><CODE>WRITE3()</CODE></A> act on entire time steps --
    i.e., of all variables -- at once; otherwise, they can be used to
    store or retrieve time steps of individual variables one at a time. 
    There are moderate performance advantages to writing the variables
    for a time step in the same order that they appear in the file
    description, and for writing the time steps in consecutive order;
    however, this is not required by the I/O&nbsp;API (which permits any
    access order to the data, for both read and write operations).

    custom data--this is just a user-dimensioned array of
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#basic"> REAL, INTEGER, or
    DOUBLE PRECISION </A> that the system reads and writes reliably; it's
    up to you to interpret its structure for yourself.  (This type
    was included on the &quot;I probably haven't thought of everything&quot;
    principle.)  A typical argument declaration for a set of variables
    to be used with a CUSTOM file would look like the following, where
    the dimensioning constant  <CODE>SIZE</CODE> maps into the
    <CODE>NCOLS3D</CODE> <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> file description </A>
    parameter; <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> and <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> are ignored):

<H2> <A NAME = "dctnry"> <STRONG>DCTNRY3</STRONG> </A> = 0: </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    dictionary--the reusable parts of a file description;
    this data type is used to store and retrieve the following parts of an
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> file description:
<PRE>
    FTYPE3D, TSTEP3D, NCOLS3D, NROWS3D, NLAYS3D, NVARS3D, NTHIK3D,
    GDTYP3D, P_ALP3D, P_BET3D, P_GAM3D, XORIG3D, YORIG3D, XCELL3D,
    YCELL3D, GDNAM3D, XCENT3D, YCENT3D, VNAME3D, UNITS3D, VDESC3D
</PRE>

    Note that all of these dimensioning and descriptive attributes are,
    of course, themselves not applicable to the DCTNRY3 file, and that
    the data structures for storage and retrieval are already defined
    for you in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A>.

    Dictionary files can be used to make much easier the process of
    file creation within a particular model.  To do this, you would
    begin by standardizing on names for file structure templates, and
    then build a dictionary file which contains these templates.  A
    modeler needing to create or open a file with template name
    &quot;FOO&quot;  and logical name &quot;MY_FOO&quot; using the
    dictionary with logical name &quot;D&quot; would then do the
    following (using the dictionary file, routines
    <A HREF = "READ3.html"> READ3() </A> to get the
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT file description </A> and
    <A HREF = "OPEN3.html"> OPEN3() </A> to create or open the
    file using it):
    <PRE>
    ...
C........ Assume that dictionary file D has been opened.
C........ Use READ3() on this dictionary file to put the
C........ standard parts of a file description into
C........ the FDESC3 data structures:

    IF ( .NOT. READ3( 'D', 'FOO', 0, 0, 0, 0 ) ) THEN
        CALL M3ERR( 'my routine', 0, 0,
 &amp;      'Could not read file template FOO from dictionary D',
 &amp;      .TRUE. )
    END IF

C........ Now put the timestep, starting date, and starting time
C........into the file description

    SDATE3D = JDATE
    STIME3D = JTIME
    TSTEP3D = TSTEP

C........ Call OPEN3 to open FOO (in this case as an UNKNOWN --
C........ create if necessary; otherwise perform consistency check):

    IF ( .NOT. OPEN3( 'MY_FOO', FSUNKN3, 'my routine' ) ) THEN
        CALL M3EXIT( 'my routine', JDATE, JTIME,
 &amp;      'Could not open/create file MY_FOO', 2 )
    END IF
    ...
    </PRE>

    Dictionary files <EM>support</EM> model management policies having
    standardized file templates, but do not <EM>mandate</EM> them
    (since one can fill in an entire file description in-line before
    calling OPEN3() to create non-standard files).  This gives
    opportunities both for rigor and accountability and for
    flexibility.  An interesting application of the flexibility and
    power thus afforded is that of  multiple-grid situations such as
    you find with two-way  nesting, where it is perfectly reasonable
    to have one dictionary per  grid (say &quot;D_GRID1&quot; ,
    &quot;D_GRID2&quot; , ..., with  all the dictionaries sharing a
    common set of names for the  templates they contain.  Programs can
    then fetch file  descriptions (say for the grid-<VAR>n</VAR> template
    &quot;FOO&quot;) as

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    sparse matrix data, which uses a &quot;skyline-transpose&quot;
    representation for sparse matrices, such as those found in the
    emissions model prototype.  An example of the sort of data
    structure needed for these sparse matrices is the following:
<PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER     NMATX   !  number of coefficients in the matrix
    INTEGER     NROWS   !  number of rows in the matrix
    PARAMETER ( NMATX = 233100, NGRID = 5400 )
    ...
    INTEGER     NS( NROWS ) !  # of actual cols per row
    INTEGER     IS( NMATX ) !  column pointers
    REAL        CS( NMATX ) !  col-coefficients

    COMMON  / GRIDMAT / NS, IS, CS
</PRE>

    The coefficients dimension <CODE>NMATX</CODE> maps into the
    <CODE>NCOLS3D</CODE> dimension and the matrix-rows dimension
    <CODE>NROWS</CODE> maps into the <CODE>NROWS3D</CODE> dimension
    in the file description <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">
    FDESC3.EXT </A> data structures.  <CODE>NTHIK3D</CODE> is the
    number of (actual) columns in the original (full, not sparse)
    matrix (not used directly by the I/O&nbsp;API, but it may be very
    useful to users of the data).  To read or write this data,
    put the first element, <CODE>NS,</CODE> of the common
    <CODE>GRIDMAT</CODE> in the &quot;array&quot; argunent spot of
    <A HREF = "READ3.html"><CODE>READ3()</CODE></A> or

<P>

    To form a matrix-vector product P = M * V in this representation,
    use <A HREF="SMATVEC.html"><CODE>SMATVEC()</CODE></A>, which has
    the following algorithm (for v3.1 and earlier, or its parallel equivalent,
    below, for I/O&nbsp;API v3.2 or later):
    <PRE>
    ...
    INTEGER K, C, R
    REAL    SUM, P( NROWS ), V( NCOLS )
    ...
    K = 0
    DO  R = 1, NROWS
        SUM = 0.0
        DO  C = 1, NS( R )
            K = K + 1
            SUM = SUM + CS( K ) * V( IS( K ) )
        END DO
        P( R ) = SUM
    END DO
    </PRE>
    <P>

    <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> that because of the way <CODE>NS</CODE> is
    defined, and the resulting serial dependencies with <CODE>K</CODE>,
    <STRONG>this is inherently a serial algorithm.</STRONG>  For an
    OpenMP parallel matrix multiplication, one may construct
    <EM>cumulative</EM> counts <CODE>CNT(0:NROWS)</CODE> as follows:
    <PRE>
    CNT( 0 ) = 0
    DO  R = 1, NROWS
        CNT( R ) = CNT( R-1 ) + NX( R )
    END DO
    </PRE>
    and then one has the following equivalent (and slightly more
    efficient, even as a serial code!) parallel algorithm:
    <PRE>
!$OMP   PARALLEL DO
!$OMP&    DEFAULT( NONE ),
!$OMP&     SHARED( NROWS, CNT, IS, CS, U, V ),
!$OMP&    PRIVATE( R, SUM )

    DO  R = 1, NROWS
        SUM = 0.0
        DO  K = CNT( R-1 )+1, CNT( R )
            SUM = SUM  +  CS( K ) * U( IS( K ) )
        END DO
        V( R ) = SUM
    END DO
    </PRE>

    <STRONG>NOTE ALSO</STRONG> that we can use sparse matrices with
    <STRONG>no</STRONG> variables&mdash;just the index parts&mdash;<CODE>NS,IS</CODE>
    as <STRONG>incidence matrices</STRONG> describing many-to-one
    relations&mdash;&quot;what point sources are in each grid
