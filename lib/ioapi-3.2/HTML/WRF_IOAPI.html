    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The exercise of &quot;wrapperizing&quot; the Models-3/EDSS
    I/O&nbsp;API (M3IO) within the WRF I/O&nbsp;API (WRFIO) is
    dominated by just a few issues:

    <UL>
        <LI>  different approaches to dataset/variable/metadata definition,
        <LI>  data distribution issues
        <LI>  date&time sequencing assumptions
        <LI>  similar/compatible approaches to field I/O (albeit with
              somewhat different allocation of responsibility for
              gather/scatter)
        <LI>  minor data structure differences
    </UL>
    These issues are quite resolvable. This paper gives a suggested
    implementation of the M3IO external I/O package within WRFIO, along
    with the metadata dictionary needed by the WRF
    &quot;configure/build&quot; system, additional requirements that
    this places on WRFIO, thoughts for an enhanced M3IO, and suggestions
    for augmenting WRFIO.
    <P>

    The current plan is a two-stage one:
    <OL>
        <LI>  to construct a restricted prototype WRFIO
              <CODE>ext_m3io</CODE> package on top of a minimally
              modified version of M3IO, for use with the Summer&nbsp;2002
              air quality forecast effort; and
              <P>
        <LI>  to construct an enhanced version of the Models-3/EDSS
              I/O&nbsp;API (M4IO), together with a full-function WRFIO
              <CODE>ext_m4io</CODE> package built on top of it.
    </OL><P>
    As this document is being written, the effort to implement (1)
    is underway.  This effort is bearing fruit in terms of finding
    &quot;holes&quot;, ambiguities, and other difficulties in the WRFIO
    specification.

    <A NAME="defs">Dataset Definition Issues</A>
</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    M3IO takes the point of view that the API should encapsulate state
    to the greatest degree possible, and avoid shared state between
    itself and its callers.  For example, a dataset must be defined
    in one atomic operation, in which the user fills in all the fields
    in a dataset definition and then calls the <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE>
    routine.  Similarly, to get a file's metadata, one makes a single
    <CODE>DESC3()</CODE> call and is returned the complete description
    of a dataset, together with all its metadata.  As is appropriate
    for providing the level of commonality and integrity required of
    an API used for multi-model environmental modeling applications,
    for model coupling, and for easy callability from legacy Fortran-77
    applications, the set of metadata required is fixed by a
    proscriptive standard; it is an error not to supply the complete
    set of metadata needed by <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> during data set
    creation.  
    <P>

    On the other hand, the WRFIO paradigm is to supply tools that allow
    the definition of an open-ended set of metadata, at the modeler's
    discretion, but with the added complication of considerable shared
    state between WRFIO and its callers.  The
    <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_get|put*()</CODE> routines in WRFIO allow
    the user to define a dataset incrementally by means of repeated calls.
    Provided that the &quot;configure/build&quot; system can ensure
    that all of the definitions expected by the M3IO are made (between
    calls to  <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_open_for_write_begin()</CODE>
    and <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_open_for_write()</CODE>), there would
    seem to be no conceptual difficulty in wrapperizing M3IO within
    WRFIO.  A complete dictionary of the metadata which must be set in
    order to completely define an M3IO-implemented data set is given
    in the section below, <EM><A HREF="#dict">Required-Attribute
    Dictionary</A>.</EM> <BR>
    <STRONG>Ensuring that the &quot;configure/build&quot; system
    generates all the required definitions and metadata attributions
    during data set creation is a fundamental constraint of this
    &quot;wrapperizing&quot; approach.</STRONG>
    <P>

    One problem with this open-ended operational paradigm is the
    lack of routines&nbsp;--&nbsp;within both WRFIO and M3IO as they
    presently exist&nbsp;--&nbsp;for inquiring about the existence,
    names, and types of metadata that have been stored in a WRF data
    set, as we describe in the section, <EM><A HREF="#addl">Additional
    Requirements</A></EM>, below.
    <P>

    A minor implementation issue is that M3IO only supports input and
    output of fields of types <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>,
    and <CODE>REAL8</CODE>, whereas WRF also has fields of type
    <CODE>LOGICAL</CODE>.  It will be very simple to add support for
    the additional <CODE>LOGICAL</CODE> type required by WRF, and it
    has recently become understood how to add the
    <CODE>CHARACTER(LEN=&lt;n&gt;</CODE> types requested by EPA for
    emissions and observational data.  Changes for these new types 
    not will break backwards data, source, nor link compatibility of
    M3IO.
    <P>
    
    A larger issue is what to do with attributes not expected by
    M3IO (which has a fixed list of what attributes it expects, as
    documented below in the section <EM><A HREF="#dict">Required 
    Attribute Dictionary</A></EM> ); we
    conclude that the wrapper should go ahead and read or write these
    attributes at the raw netCDF (or PVM or other) lower I/O level, so
    that the resulting data sets are &quot;M3IO-plus&quot;, with
    additional metadata not maintained by the M3IO proper.  (Due to the
    selective direct access nature of the underlying netCDF and PVM
    M3IO-implementation layers, the existence of additional attributes
    not accessed by the existing system is irrelevant to that system.) 
    This WRF requirement implied by the open-ended set of &quot;put
    attribute calls could lead to an augmentation of the existing M3IO,
    for the creation, inquiry, and access to additional metadata within
    M3IO datasets (probably the cleanest way to implement this WRF
    requirement).  This issue,as well as the previous type extension
    issue, is discussed further below in the section, <EM><A
    HREF="#m4io"> Enhancements to the Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</A>.</EM> 
    <P>

    Another issue that does come up is the issue of time-dependent
    metadata, implied by the <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_put_*_td_type()</CODE>
    routines:  netCDF does not have provisions for implementing time
    dependent metadata, and consequently neither does M3IO.  Presently,
    these are not used by the WRF model itself, and the draft document
    indicates &quot;not yet implemented&quot;.  One way to implement
    these is as by auxilliary variables in the data set; doing so puts
    some additional constraints on WRFIO, as we describe below in the
    section, <EM><A HREF="#addl">Additional Requirements</A>.</EM>
    <P>

    A final issue is the issue of WRF
    &quot;stagger&quot;&nbsp;--&nbsp;for M3IO files, all variables have
    the same grid structure, so that (for an MM5/MAQSIP example), the
    dot point variables (for which WRF stagger is
    <CODE>&quot;XY&quot;</CODE>) inhabit different files from the cross
    point variables(for which WRF stagger is none, coded
    <CODE>&quot;-&quot;</CODE>).  The three obvious potential solutions
    to this problem are (1)&nbsp;to extend M3IO to support stagger;
    (2)&nbsp;to dimension files to the extent of
    <CODE>&quot;XY&quot;</CODE> stagger, pad all output variables out
    to the extent of those dimensions (and subset on input), and to add
    extra per-variable attributes describing the stagger-padding,
    Z-staggered variables being written both to the 2-D and the 3-D
    M3IO data sets that represent a particular WRFIO data set; or
    (3)&nbsp;to let a WRFIO data set be implemented by multiple files,
    one for each stagger type.  We recommend alternative&nbsp;(1)
    below, in the section, <EM><A HREF="#m4io"> Enhancements to the
    Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</A>.</EM>
    <P>
    
    <EM>Due to the difficulties of maintaining the data structures
    necessary to store some indefinite number of additional
    non-standard metadata of multiple unknown types and sizes,
    <STRONG>the initial M3IO implementation of WRFIO to be used for the
    Summer&nbsp;2002 air quality forecasting will not support any metadata
    except per-variable stagger and those metadata already standard for
    M3IO.</STRONG></EM>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The WRFIO <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_read|write_field()</CODE> calls
    map fairly cleanly to M3IO <CODE>READ3()</CODE> and
    <CODE>WRITE3()</CODE> calls -- the biggest difference being the
    domain and patch dimensionality and stagger info contained in the
    calls, and the added per-level optional selectivity offered by
    the M3IO <CODE>READ3()</CODE>.  The WRFIO notions of &quot;output
    frames&quot; and  <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_get_next_var()</CODE>
    (etc.) can easily be implemented by maintaining an internal
    per-dataset state variable that keeps the current-frame simulation
    clock and current variable for the dataset.
    <P>

    Initially, we propose to to support two modes of operation, based
    on data distribution--the modes that do <EM>not</EM> do distributed
    gather/scatter operations within WRFIO, with place-holders in
    place to extend to a third which does implement internal WRFIO
    gather/scatter, as described below.  (As we understand it, this
    restriction is consistent with the current functionalities
    supported by the netCDF implementation, as well.)

    <A NAME="date">Dates and Times; Sequencing Issues</A>
</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    M3IO clock objects use pairs <CODE>INTEGER&nbsp;JDATE,JTIME</CODE>
    to represent time accurate to (exact integer) seconds, using a
    coding of <CODE>YYYYDDD:HHMMSS</CODE>; time steps are exact
    integers coded <CODE>H*MMSS</CODE>.  There is a complete set of
    routines for date and time manipulation; the entire system is robust
    with respect to negative time steps and  &quot;denormalized&quot;
    dates and times such as <CODE>1999476:-234567</CODE> (this
    represents April 19, 2000 at 00:13:53--a date&amp;time 23 hours, 45
    minutes, and 67 seconds before the 476-365=111'th day of the year
    2000).  WRFIO clock objects use <CODE>character(len=??)</CODE>
    strings (of various inconsistent lengths in the documentation) and
    documented as accurate to milliseconds and formatted
    <CODE>YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.SSS</CODE>.  What to do if the
    millisecond field for an M3IO implementation of WRFIO is nonzero is
    an open problem; however, it is not unreasonable that for many (or
    even most) applications, the WRF model time step will be an integer
    number of seconds, and this issue can be avoided.  (On the other
    hand, there is a request for an enhanced I/O API that maintains an
    even more accurate notion of clock object, as documented below in
    the section, <EM><A HREF="#m4io"> Enhancements to the Models-3
    I/O&nbsp;API</A>.</EM>  With Fortran-90/95 function overloading,
    one can even make this enhancement transparent to existing
    applications, as a (hidden-by-F90) M3IO extension.  The M3IO direct
    access mode of operation, and hence its deterministic record-number
    requirement can be preserved either by the use of rational-number
    fraction fields, or by double-precision fraction-fields (which have
    sufficient numerical precision that millisecond-level error
    tolerances can be preserved even for very long time step
    sequences).  For the initial M3IO version for the Summer&nbsp;2002 air
    quality forecasting effort, we will require exact-integer time
    steps; for the full M4IO, we will choose one of the enhanced
    formulations.
    <P>

    An issue arises with respect to time-step sequences.  For M3IO,
    time step sequences are characterized by a <STRONG>starting
    date</STRONG>, a <STRONG>starting time</STRONG>, and a <STRONG>time
    step</STRONG>.  The correspondence between elements of a time step
    sequence and &quot;record numbers&quot; is a deterministic one, as
    made possible by the facts that the relevant arithmetic is exact
    integer arithmetic and that the time step is constant for the
    entire time step sequence.  This will create a
    &quot;show-stopper&quot; problem for data sets of high temporal
    resolution, if a WRF driver were constructed to use an adaptive
    time step scheme.  For coarser output time steps (i.e.,
    substantially larger than the solver time-step), we would resort
    to the scheme used by the <CODE>MCPL()</CODE>  output module for
    MM5, to deal with the non-determinism of pre-Version-3 MM5
    time-keeping:  find the model time step that <EM>contains</EM> the
    desired input or output time step, and thereby keeping the temporal
    error at most one model time step (probably good enough for hourly
    input, for example).
    <P>
    
    A special case of this is the case of time-independent data: 
    presently, I can see no means in WRFIO to define that a variable is
    time-independent (at least in the documentation to which I have
    access, nor do I see provision for time independent variables
    implied in what I read of the Registry.  On the other hand, there
    are a number of variables for which it is clearly worthwhile to note
    that they are time independent: <VAR>z</VAR>, <VAR>pb</VAR>,
    <VAR>pb8w</VAR>, <VAR>msft</VAR>, <VAR>msfu</VAR>,
    <VAR>msfv</VAR>, <VAR>f</VAR>, <VAR>e</VAR>, <VAR>sina</VAR>,
    <VAR>cosb</VAR>, <VAR>ht</VAR>, etc.
    <P>

    Another issue is the WRFIO concept of <STRONG>input and output
    frames</STRONG>.  Since M3IO does selective direct access I/O,
    it naturally performs I/O operations when they are requested,
    and the sequential-file &quot;frame&quot; concept is not even
    relevant.  As far as I can tell, however, this is of issue only 
    in terms of requiring that the external M3IO package for WRFIO
    must maintain and update the state variables related to frames
    (<CODE>ext_m3io_end_of_frame(DataHandle,Status)</CODE> must
    increment the specified data set's date&amp;time, for example).
    <P>

              &quot;month&quot; and &quot;year&quot; do not have
              invariant meanings, there should not be month-fields and

              augmentation of the <CODE>Registry</CODE> so that it

              or time stepped, and a means within the WRF&nbsp;API to
              communicate this fact to WRFIO.  For this latter, the
              standard could be that a dry-run call to 
              <CODE>ext_<VAR>pkg</VAR>_write_field()</CODE> for which
              the <CODE>DateStr</CODE> argument is identically zero
              (i.e., <CODE>00:00:00.0000</CODE>) designates the

        <DT>  <STRONG>Grid and Map Projection characterization</STRONG>
        <DD>  Mathematically, the notion of a <VAR>grid</VAR> is

              <BLOCKQUOTE>
              A <STRONG>map projection</STRONG> is a mapping from a domain on
              the surface of the Earth into a rectangle in a
              two-dimensional Cartesian space
              <STRONG>R<SUP>2</SUP></STRONG>.  The common mesoscale
              examples&nbsp;-- Lambert conformal conic, polar secant
              sterographic, equatorial Mercator&nbsp;-- require not
              only a set of (typically 3) defining angles, but also a
              Cartesian origin for their specification.  It is not
              necessarily the case that the Cartesian origin falls at
              an origin &quot;central lat-lon&quot; coincident with the
              defining angles of the projection.  This would seem to be
              an unwarranted assumption.  Moreover, at the <VAR>Meso-Gamma</VAR>
              and finer scales targeted by the WRF, there will be a
              desire (at least for air quality applications) to 
              support for the so-called <VAR>Universal Transverse
              Mercator (UTM)</VAR> map projections, by the way.
              <P>
              A <STRONG>grid</STRONG> has a map projection and a &quot;lattice
              structure&quot; defined in terms of that grid -- typically
              needing the following, of which I can find only the last
              two in the <VAR>Registry</VAR>.  One can not assume that
              the grid must be centered relative to the Cartesian origin
              of the map projection, especially as one goes to smaller
              scales (and there can be particular modeling advantages to
              having the grid off-center, if by so doing one can line up
              a coordinate axis with the prevailing winds of the domain
              modeled).

              Air quality modeling experience shows that there is
              relatively frequent use of the selective-read operations
              that pick out just one level (especially the model-bottom
              level) from a 3-D field.  Given a selective direct-access

              Full functionality requires a complete set of inquiry

                  <LI>  If the file exists, check that its definition
                        is consistent with the caller-supplied

                  <LI>  In particular, if the caller-supplied starting

              definition.  (This one was added at the insistence of the
              visualization people, who wanted it for scratch files, and
              who alone are allowed to use it: By agreement between the
              heads of EPA ORD and MCNC Environmental Modeling Center,
              modelers are forbidden to use this mode, on pain of being

              five years, on a 386/25 running Windows 3.0 and Microsoft

    M4IO:  Enhancements to the Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</A>
</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    There are a number of potential modifications to the Models-3
    I/O&nbsp;API that would ameliorate incompatibilities between it and
    the WRF I/O&nbsp;API.  Some of these would cause source-code, link,
    or data incompatibilities with the existing M3IO (which has been
    carefully-maintained to preserve backward compatibility), and would
    at the very least lead to a
    <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/flag-day.html">
    &quot;flag day&quot;.</A>  For this reason, and because the
    WRF-Chem air quality model which (because of its planned use of
    SMOKE) is one of the  chief targets of this effort will in fact be
    a <EM>fourth generation</EM> air quality model (as the EPA's
    Models-3 is of the third generation), it is attractive to create a
    new library&nbsp;--&nbsp;<STRONG>M4IO</STRONG>&nbsp;--as a
    follow-on to M3IO.  At the same time (if for no other reason than
    SMOKE compatibility), it is desirable to make compatibility between
    M3IO and M4IO as great as possible.  It may be possible to make
    this almost entirely transparent by using Fortran-90 subroutine
    overloading for M4IO (although the Fortran-90 type system is not
    strong enough to do <EM>all</EM> that the API needs to do).
    <P>

    <EM><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG>Given the time and level of effort
    required to implement all the M3IO enhancements given below, and
    the level of agreement with EPA needed for M4IO acceptance by them,
    we propose that for the initial WRFIO-to-M3IO implementation to be
    used for the Summer&nbsp;2002 air quality forecasting effort, we use the
    current version (Version&nbsp;2.1) of M3IO, and require the
    following constraints upon WRF configurations used with it:
    <UL>
        <LI>  Dates, times, and time steps are exactly representible in
              integer seconds (i.e., no fractional seconds).
        <LI>  Variable-names and units-designations have length at most
              16 characters.
        <LI>  No M3IO-nonstandard nor time dependent metadata will be
              stored.
        <LI>  WRFIO Data sets are represented as pairs of M3IO data
              sets, and have logical names built according to the
              formulas:
              <CODE>
        M3IONAME&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRIM(WRFIONAME);&nbsp;//&nbsp;_(2D|3D)
              </CODE>
              e.g., the WRF data set <CODE>HISTORY1</CODE> becomes the 
              pair of M3IO files <CODE>HISTORY1_2D</CODE> and
              <CODE>HISTORY1_3D</CODE>.
        <LI>  &quot;stagger&quot; implemented by padding on output, and
              pad-stripping on input, Z-stagger being implemented by 
              writing the surface level to the 2-D M3IO file and the
              elevated levels to the 3-D M3IO file.

              other approaches for date&time objects that are even
              stronger than millisecond temporal resolution (where
              below, <VAR>date</VAR> has a resolution of 1 day, and
              <VAR>time</VAR> has a resolution of 1 second):

              long time step sequences.  Multi-century runs would run
              into difficulty, however.  The rational-number approach
              has the virtue of exact arithmetic; however, it is much
              more complex both for us to implement and for the average
              modeler to use.  Currently, I (CJC) favor the first of
              these approaches, in terms of maximizing the combination
              of usability and precision.

    Mapping WRFIO Data Sets to M3IO Data Sets
    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

        Each WRF data set will be implemented as a <STRONG>set of
        M3IO data sets</STRONG>, as necessitated by the fact  that
        individual M3IO data sets have homogeneous time step, layer, 
        and horizontal grid structures.  The decision of just how
        &quot;stagger&quot; is implemented will determine just how
        many M3IO data sets there will be for each WRF data set.
        <P>

        Another issue that comes up in this regard is the issue of
        <STRONG>name bindings</STRONG>:  both the WRFIO and the M3IO
        systems achieve directory independence by mapping <VAR>logical
        names</VAR> for data sets into <VAR>physical (path) names for
        files</VAR>.  Logical names are program-properties but do not
        imply actual file-system location or implementation by other 
        means.  This independence allows M3IO transparently to support
        both persistent file-based data sets and PVM-mailbox based
        communications channels for coupling a set of cooperating
        processes (as will be used initially to couple SMOKE with WRF.
        M3IO uses environment variables (e.g., set using the
        <VAR>csh</VAR> <CODE>setenv</CODE> command) to bind logical
        names to physical names; WRF traditionally uses
        <CODE>NAMELIST</CODE>s.  It may be possible to enhance the
        underlying M3IO environment variable routines so that they
        support both means of name binding.  If so, this allows us
        to perform a transparent &quot;behind the scenes &quot;
        upgrade that supports both means of name bindings when the
        enhanced routines become available.
        <P>
        
        <EM>For the initial implementation to be used for the
        Summer&nbsp;2002 air quality forecast effort, we propose
        that the <CODE>ext_m3io_ </CODE> package behave as follows:
        <UL>
             <LI>  Each WRFIO data set is implemented as a pair of
                   M3IO data sets:  the 2-D data set and the 3-D data
                   set.
             <LI>  Initially, &quot;stagger&quot; will be implemented 
                   by padding,
             <LI>  Environment variable name binding will be employed.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

        This module encapsulates the state necessary to maintain the
        WRF datasets, as well as the input and output frames for each
        of them.  It is <CODE>USE</CODE>d by the subroutines in
        <CODE>ext_m3io.F90</CODE>, which implements all of the
        <CODE>ext_m3io_*()</CODE> wrapper calls that give the WRFIO
        external-package API interface.  The  <CODE>ext_m3io_*()</CODE>
        routines provide Fortran-77 style (in practice, this means
        call-by-reference) implicit calling interfaces rather than
        explicit interfaces; this is necessitated by the fact that
        the subroutines (such as <CODE>ext_m3io_write_field()</CODE>
        which writes both 2D and 3D fields of types <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>,
        <CODE>LOGICAL</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and <CODE>REAL8</CODE>)
        are overloaded to act upon what an explicit Fortran-90
        interface would see as incompatible argument lists.  (IMNHO, 
        the lack of a &quot;void pointer&quot; type is a serious defect
        in the Fortran-9x standards, but we can't really do anything
        about it.)
