!  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in           !
!  continuous development by various groups and is based on information        !
!  from these groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working        !
!  within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal sources         !
!  including research institutions.  These groups give the Government          !
!  permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies       !
!  of their work in the CMAQ system to the public and to permit others         !
!  to do so.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency                !
!  therefore grants similar permission to use the CMAQ system software,        !
!  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or            !
!  products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United States        !
!  Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software              !
!  that is used with the CMAQ system but distributed under the GNU             !

! Name:     Common Header
! Purpose:  Builds a common header part for I/O API output.
! Revised:  27 Jan 1997  Created for MCIP and generalized CTM.  (D. Byun)
!           04 Feb 1998  LSM include nonglobal changed.  (D. Byun)
!           10 Sep 2001  Converted to free-form f90.  (T. Otte)
!           30 Jul 2007  Fill FDESC3D to create metadata.  (T. Otte)
!           11 Aug 2011  Replaced module FDESC3 with I/O API module M3UTILIO.
!                        (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2011  Updated disclaimer.  (T. Otte)
!           10 Feb 2018  Reinitialize VGLVS3D on each call to accommodate
!                        additional 3D I/O API output files where the third
!                        dimension is not atmospheric layers.  (T. Spero)
