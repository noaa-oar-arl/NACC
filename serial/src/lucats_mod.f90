! Name:     Land Use Categories
! Purpose:  Contains input land use classification arrays.
! Revised:  25 Aug 2009  Original version.  (T. Otte)
!           01 Sep 2011  Include all land use information as parameter
!                        statements rather than allocatable and filled later.
!                        Eliminates need for routines ALLOC_LU, DEALLOC_LU,
!                        and INIT_LU.  (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2011  Updated disclaimer.  (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2012  Added handling for 40-category 2006 NLCD-MODIS land
!                        use classification as "NLCD40".  Added alternate name
!                        for 50-category 2001 NLCD-MODIS land use classification
!                        as "NLCD50".  Changed LUCATNLCD to LUCATNLCD50 and
!                        added new field LUCATNLCD40.  (T. Otte)
!           01 Feb 2018  Updated MODIS category 21 to be "Lake".  (T. Spero)
!           22 Jun 2018  Changed name of module LUVARS to LUCATS to minimize
!                        confusion.  (T. Spero)
!           08 Aug 2018  Corrected bug in setting land use category names in
!                        MCIP for USGS24 + lakes.  (T. Spero)
