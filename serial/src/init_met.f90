! Name:     Initialize Meteorology Arrays
! Purpose:  Initializes meteorology arrays.
! Revised:  10 Sep 2001  Original version.  (T. Otte)
!           29 May 2003  Added SNOWCOVR.  (D. Schwede)
!           09 Aug 2004  Added QGA, VEGOLD, and T2.  (D. Schwede and T. Otte)
!           29 Nov 2004  Added LUFRAC.  (T. Otte)
!           04 Apr 2005  Removed unused variables REGIME and MAVAIL.  Added PH,
!                        PHB, PB, MU, and MUB for WRF.  Added U10 and V10.
!                        (T. Otte and S.-B. Kim)

!                        (T. Otte)
!           25 Jul 2007  Removed internal variables for emissivity and net
!                        radiation.  Eliminated logical variable "PX" to make
!                        code more general.  (T. Otte)
!           05 May 2008  Added 2-m mixing ratio (Q2) and turbulent kinetic
!                        energy (TKE) arrays.  Added urban fraction (FRC_URB)
!                        and urban roughness length (Z0C_URB2D) for
!                        MET_UCMCALL=1.  (T. Otte)

!                        and non-convective precipitation.  (T. Otte)
!           01 Sep 2011  Corrected initialization of ISLTYP to match variable
!                        type.  (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2011  Updated disclaimer.  (T. Otte)
!           11 Sep 2012  Added LANDMASK to be read from WRF.  (T. Otte)
!           10 Apr 2015  Added new array CLDFRA to pass 3D resolved cloud
!                        fraction to output.  (T. Spero)
!           21 Aug 2015  Changed latent heat flux from QFX to LH.  Added
!                        moisture flux (QFX) for IFMOLACM.  (T. Spero)
!           16 Mar 2018  Added SNOWH to output.  Added C1H, C2H, C1F, and C2F to
!                        support hybrid vertical coordinate in WRF.  Added
!                        LUFRAC2, MOSCATIDX, LAI_MOS, RA_MOS, RS_MOS, TSK_MOS,
!                        and ZNT_MOS to support NOAH Mosaic land-surface model.
!                        Added DZS to capture soil layers, and added 3D soil
!                        arrays, SOIT3D and SOIM3D.  Added WSPDSFC and XLAIDYN
!                        for Noah.  (T. Spero)
!           14 Sep 2018  Changed condition to enable hybrid vertical coordinate
!                        in WRF.  Removed support for MM5v3 input.  (T. Spero)
!           18 Jun 2019  Added new surface variables with PX LSM that can
!                        improve dust simulation in CCTM.  Added optional
!                        variables from KF convective scheme with radiative
!                        feedbacks.  (T. Spero)
