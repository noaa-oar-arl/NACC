# The NOAA-ARL Atmosphere-Chemistry Coupler (NACC)

The NOAA-ARL Atmosphere-Chemistry Coupler (NACC) is adapted from the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP), and can ingest output from the [Finite Volume Cubed Sphere (FV3)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) version of the [Global Forecast System (GFS)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) and the [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model](http://www.wrf-model.org) to prepare the meteorology files that are used within the CMAQ Modeling System. Where possible, MCIP uses data directly from the meteorological model to maximize consistency with the CMAQ Modeling System. When specific atmospheric fields are not explicitly output by WRF, MCIP uses scientific algorithms to create those fields for CMAQ.  MCIP output is used by the emissions model (for example, to provide time-varying temperatures for mobile emissions) and by the CCTM to define the atmospheric conditions. A scientific overview of MCIP is in [Otte and Pleim (2010)](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/3/243/2010/).  

NACC was developed by Dr. Patrick C. Campbell and Dr. Youhua Tang, with support from the entire NOAA-ARL research team (Contact:  Patrick.C.Campbell@noaa.gov).  Unless otherwise necessary, hereafter the documentation of the MCIP-based NACC code will only be referred to as the NACC.

NACC performs the following functions using the output (history) file from WRF or FV3-GFS:

-   Defines the computational domain for the CCTM. The CCTM typically uses a smaller computational domain than the meteorological model, and the lateral boundary cells from the meteorological model generally are not used by CCTM.

-   Extracts meteorological model output on the computational domain that is prescribed for the CCTM.

-   Processes all required meteorological fields for the emissions model and the CCTM. Meteorological fields such as atmospheric temperature, pressure, humidity, and winds are acquired directly from the meteorological model (i.e., "passed through").

-   Uses the available meteorological fields to compute additional fields that are required by the CCTM but are not part of the meteorological model's output stream, such as the Jacobian which is used for coordinate transformations.

-   Outputs files that contain meteorological and geospatial information used by the emissions model and the CCTM.  The output can be either in I/O API or netCDF.

NACC is written in FORTRAN, and this version runs on a single processor in a Unix/Linux environment. NACC is driven by a C-shell or K-shell script with several run-time options that are defined through a FORTRAN namelist. It is typical to use NACC to process hourly output fields from the meteorological model for each one-day period.

NACC is often updated concurrently with the CCTM.  The changes to NACC are documented with each update to the software, and a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) file exists that is specific to NACC.

As of NACCv1.0 (based on MCIPv5.0), WRF and FV3-GFS are the only meteorological models that can be processed with NACC, but NACC could be expanded to process data from other meteorological models.

NACC can be used to determine the spatial region that is processed by CMAQ. NACC can process the full meteorological modeling domain, uniformly trim cells from that domain, or "window" a rectilinear subset of that domain. Configuration options for NACC include the time periods over which to extract data from the meteorological model output files, horizontal and vertical grid definitions, native or collapsed vertical layer definition and selections for integrating satellite cloud observations into NACC output.

## Files, configuration, and environment variables

All NACC configurations are established at run-time (rather than at compile time) via Fortran namelist variables rather than environment variables, which is a distinction from the rest of the CMAQ programs. The user does not need to directly edit the NACC namelist file. All configuration settings are contained in the NACC run script (run_nacc*.csh or run_nacc*.ksh), which automatically creates a new namelist file each time the script is executed.  The NACC output files are listed in Table 1, and the NACC output files are listed in Table 2.


## Compilation Configuration

All model configuration options for NACC are set during execution. System compiler options must be set in the provided Linux Makefile to build the program for different operating system/compiler combinations. Example compiler paths, flags, and library locations are provided in the default Makefile.

    The number of boundary points to remove on each of the four horizontal sides of the meteorology output to define the NACC output domain. Setting BTRIM = 0 will specify the maximum extent of the input meteorology domain. To remove the WRF lateral boundaries, set BTRIM = 5 (recommended).
    This setting affects the output NACC horizontal domain by reducing the input meteorology domain by 2*BTRIM + 2*NTHIK + 1, where NTHIK is the lateral boundary thickness (from the BDY files). The extra point reflects the conversion from the grid points (dot points) to grid cells (cross points).
    To crop a subset of the input meteorology ("window"), set BTRIM = -1; this setting causes BTRIM to be replaced by the information provided by X0, Y0, NCOLS, and NROWS (see below).
-   `X0 [used only if BTRIM = -1]`  
    The *x*-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the full NACC cross-point domain (including the NACC lateral boundary) based on the input WRFâ€‘ARW domain. X0 refers to the east-west direction.

    Number of columns in the output NACC domain (excluding NACC lateral boundaries)
-   `NROWSIN [used only if BTRIM = -1]`  
    Number of rows in the output NACC domain (excluding NACC lateral boundaries)

    Row cell coordinate for diagnostic outputs on the NACC modeling domain
-   `WRF_LC_REF_LAT [optional; used only for Lambert conformal projections; default: -999.0]`  
    WRF Lambert Conformal reference latitude. Use this setting to force the reference latitude in the output NACC data. If not set, NACC will use the average of the two true latitudes.
-   `projparm [FV3GFS-Only; used  to define projection parameters for subset of global grid; example set: GDTYP=2, P_ALP=33., P_BET=45., P_GAM=-97., XCENT=-97., YCENT=40.]`  
    Required definition of grid projection parameters for FV3GFS. Use this setting to subset the FV3-GFS global domain that is regridded to use in CMAQ.
-   `domains [FV3GFS-Only; used  to define domain grid information for subset of global grid; example set XORIG=-2508000., YORIG=-1716000., DX=12000., DY=12000., NROWS=442, NCOLS=265]`

## Compiling and Running

**Compile NACC**

NACC is compiled with a Makefile. The configuration options in the Makefile include the compiler and compiler flags to use for building the executable. Note that this version of NACC is not a parallelized code, so parallel versions of netCDF and I/O API are not required.  The Makefile is located in the directory with the NACC source code (`$CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/src`). To compile NACC, source the config_cmaq.csh file and invoke the Makefile at the command line:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/src/
source $CMAQ_HOME/config_cmaq.csh
./make |& tee make.mcip.log
```

To port NACC to different compilers, change the compiler names, locations, and flags in the config_cmaq.csh script.

**Run NACC**

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run NACC to produce meteorology input data for the CCTM:

```
cdÂ $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/scripts
./run_mcip.csh |& tee run_mcip.log
```

|mcip_bdy.nc|netCDF|contains time-independent and time-varying output along the domain perimeter|required, if IOFORM=2| 

The default location of the NACC output files is the `$CMAQ_HOME/data/mcip/$GridName` directory, but it can be changed in the NACC script using the `$OutDir` variable. The names of the NACC output files are generic and do not have any information about the model grid that they are simulating or the time period that is covered. These attributes can be controlled by the NACC script. For example, the name of the grid can be used in the output directory path. In addition, the default naming convention for all NACC output files appends the `APPL` environment variable to the file name to identify files by the time period that is represented by the file. All of the file naming variables for the NACC outputs are set in the run script, and they can be easily tailored to fit each user's application or style.
