SUBROUTINE dynflds

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Name:     Dynamic Fields
! Purpose:  Maps and calculates time-variant fields on MCIP X grids.
! Revised:  12 Sep 2001  Original version.  (T. Otte)
!           09 Jan 2002  Changed calls to "abort" to calls to "m3exit" for
!                        graceful shut-down of I/O API files.  (T. Otte)
!           28 Feb 2005  Allowed new user options for LDDEP = 3 or 4 for dry
!                        deposition velocity calculations for additional
!                        chlorine and mercury species in M3DRY.  Removed call
!                        to MET3DSUP since that subroutine was combined into
!                        METVARS2CTM.  (T. Otte)
!           27 Feb 2006  Removed unnecessary dependence on module METINFO.
!                        (T. Otte)
!           30 Jun 2006  Added SDATE and STIME to calling argument list
!                        for M3DRY.  (T. Otte)
!           24 Jul 2007  Added option to bypass dry deposition velocity
!                        calculations in MCIP so that they can be performed
!                        in the CCTM, and changed code so that M3Dry with
!                        chlorine and mercury is the only option to compute
!                        dry deposition velocities in MCIP.  Removed obsolescent
!                        user-definable run time options for recalculating PBL,
!                        cloud, and radiation fields.  (T. Otte)
!           29 Oct 2009  Added optional call to compute potential vorticity.
!                        (T. Otte)
!           12 Feb 2010  Removed unused argument GMT.  (T. Otte)
!           09 Sep 2010  Removed option to compute dry deposition velocities
!                        in MCIP.  Removed input arguments SDATE and
!                        STIME.  (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2011  Updated disclaimer.  (T. Otte)
