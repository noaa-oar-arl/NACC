SUBROUTINE getmet (mcip_now,nn)

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Name:     Get Meteorology (from MM5)
! Purpose:  Get input meteorology information from MM5v2 or MM5v3 files.
! Revised:  04 Feb 1997  Original version.  (Y.-H. Li)
!           04 Mar 1997  Added include file 'LRADMDAT.EXT'.  Replaced loop
!                        indices with METCOL, METROW, METLAY.  (D. Byun)
!           29 May 1997  Modified SUBST include for beta version.  (D. Byun)
!           05 Nov 1997  Added nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic output
!                        functions.  (D. Byun)
!           04 Feb 1998  Changed include method for nonglobals.  (D. Byun)
!           04 Mar 1998  Allow high resolution land use data.  (R. Tang)
!           19 Sep 2001  Rewrote entire section of code in and called from this
!                        routine and organized it into logical subroutines.
!                        All code is now in free-form f90.  This routine and
!                        others called within replace getmet_mm5.F.  (T. Otte)
!           12 Jan 2005  Added option to call WRF input routine.  (T. Otte)
!           19 Jun 2006  Updated error-handling if unknown meteorology model
!                        is encountered.  (T. Otte)
!           09 Apr 2007  Changed routine to directly call RDMM5V3 rather than
!                        RDMM5 because MM5v2-formatted data are no longer
!                        suppported.  (T. Otte)
!           29 Aug 2011  Improved error handling.  (T. Otte)
!           07 Sep 2011  Updated disclaimer.  (T. Otte)
!           14 Sep 2018  Removed support for MM5v3 input.  (T. Spero)
!           18 Nov 2019  Modified for FV3GFS Capability. (P. C. Campbell)
