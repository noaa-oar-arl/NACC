********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 5.0 (20 June 2019)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 5.0.  This is a major update to MCIP.
These release notes and the CHANGES file reflect all changes that have been
made to MCIP since MCIPv4.5 (the previous release).  Changes to MCIPv5.0
were made by Tanya Spero (U.S. EPA).

MCIPv5.0 accompanies CMAQv5.3.  If you are using CMAQv5.3, you should upgrade
to use MCIPv5.0.

MCIPv5.0 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.

MCIPv5.0 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

A DOI will also be available for CMAQv5.3 (which includes MCIPv5.0).

Inquiries related to potential bugs in MCIPv5.0 or questions related to
proper use of the code should be submitted to the MCIP Category in the
Forum hosted by the CMAS Center:  https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/mcip.

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file.
Users should consult the FAQ and other issues raised within the Forum
before submitting new inquiries.



MCIPv5.0 has been tested with the following Fortran compilers under both debug
and optimized options at various stages of development:  Intel 18.0, PGI 17.10,
and GCC 6.0.1.  MCIPv5.0 has been tested with netCDF 4.6.3, and I/O API 3.2.


With MCIPv5.0, the following remain deprecated:
  - Including "SOIM1", "SOIM2", "SOIT1", and "SOIT2" in METCRO2D.
    Those fields are now in a separate file that includes all soil layers and
    their associated depths (SOI_CRO).
  - Including "LUFRAC_xx" in GRIDCRO2D.  Those fields are now in a separate
    file that includes each fractional land use classification (LUFRAC_CRO).

With MCIPv5.0, the following output variables in METCRO2D remain deprecated:
     - 2-D cloud fraction (CFRAC)
     - cloud top (CLDT)
     - cloud bottom (CLDB)
     - liquid water content (WBAR)
They will be removed from METCRO2D in a forthcoming release of MCIP.


Interactions with members of the CMAQ user community led to some of the changes
that have been incorporated into MCIPv5.0.


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv5.0:

 1.  Enabled support for WRFv4.0+.

 2.  Enabled support for WRF using the hybrid vertical coordinate.

 3.  Removed support for using files from MM5.

 4.  Overhauled all I/O routines to make internal arrays more generalized to
     support additional output formats.

 5.  Removed layer collapsing.

 6.  Added an option to write MCIP output in netCDF.

 7.  Updated the units of most output fields to conform to CF compliance.

 8.  Corrected bug in setting land use category names in MCIP for
     WRF land use classification "USGS24 + lakes".

 9.  Changed fill value for convective rainfall with "no cumulus
     parameterization" from -1 to a large negative number to prevent
    inadvertent use in CCTM and post-processing.

10. Corrected error in computing precipitation amounts when the tipping bucket
    is used and less than 0.5 mm of precipitation accumulated during the same
    hour that the bucket tips; correct erroneous precipitation spikes.

11. Added 7 new 2D variables to the output if the Pleim-Xiu land-surface
    model is run in WRFv4.1+.  These variables can be used to improve the
    simulation of dust in CCTM.

12. Changed the default output wind components to the "face" points (UWINDC
    and VWINDC) from the "dot" points (UWIND and VWIND).  The "face" points
    are on the Arakawa C staggered grid that is used by both WRF and CCTM.
    The "dot" points are on the Arakawa B staggered grid used by MM5.
